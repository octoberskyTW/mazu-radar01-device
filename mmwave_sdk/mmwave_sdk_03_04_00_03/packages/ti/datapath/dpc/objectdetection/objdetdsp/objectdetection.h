/** @mainpage Object Detection Data-path Processing Chain (DPC) with DSP based DPUs
 * [TOC]
 *  @section objdetdsp_intro Overview
 *
 *  The Object detection DPC provides the functionality of processing ADC samples
 *  to detect objects during the frame acquisition and inter-frame processing
 *  periods. It can be used by an application by registering with the DPM
 *  framework and invoked using DPM APIs. The external interface of Object detection
 *  DPC can be seen at @ref DPC_OBJDET_EXTERNAL
 *
 *   @image html object_detection_datapath.png "Object Detection Data Path Processing Chain"
 *   \n
 *   \n
 *   This data path chain processing consists of:
 *   - Processing during the chirps as seen in the timing diagram(optional):
 *     - This consists of 1D (range) FFT processing that takes input from multiple
 *     receive antennae from the ADC buffer for every chirp (corresponding to the
 *     chirping pattern on the transmit antennae)
 *     and performs FFT on it and generates output into the L3 RAM in the format
 *     defined by @ref DPIF_RADARCUBE_FORMAT_1. For more details, see the doxygen
 *     documentation of range processing DPU (Data Path Unit) located at \ref dpu_range_intro
 *   - Processing during the time between the end of chirps until the beginning of the
 *     next chirping period, shown as "Inter frame Period" in the timing diagram.
 *     This processing consists of:
 *     - Doppler processing that takes input from 1D output in L3 RAM and performs
 *       2D FFT to give range-velocity detection matrix in the L3 RAM. For more details, see \ref dopplerdpu_intro_section
 *     - CFAR processing and peak grouping on detection matrix output of doppler processing.
 *       For more details, see \ref cfarca_intro_section
 *     - Angle (Azimuth, Elevation) of Arrival processing to produce a final list of
 *       detected objects with position coordinates (x,y,z) and velocity.
 *       For more details, see \ref aoaprocdpu_intro_section
 *
 *  @section objdetdsp_appdpcFlow Application-DPC Execution Flow
 *   Following diagram shows the application-DPC execution Flow.
 *
 *  @image html dpc_flow.png "Application-DPC Execution Flow"
 *
 *   The flow above shows the sequencing of initialization, configuration, execution and
 *   dynamic control operations of the DPC and some level of detail of
 *   what happens under these operations.
 *   Most of the hardware resource (e.g EDMA related) configuration
 *   for the DPUs that is issued by the DPC as part of processing
 *   @ref DPC_OBJDET_IOCTL__STATIC_PRE_START_CFG commands is provided by the
 *   application at build time using a resource file (DPC sources are built
 *   as part of building the application, there is no separate DPC library object).
 *   This file is passed as a compiler command line define
 *   @verbatim --define=APP_RESOURCE_FILE="fileName" @endverbatim The "fileName"
 *   above includes the path as if to include the file when building the the DPC sources
 *   as part of building the application, and any DPC source that needs to refer
 *   to this file (currently objectdetection.c) has the following code
 *    @verbatim #include APP_RESOURCE_FILE @endverbatim
 *   One of the demos that uses this DPC is located at ti/demo/xwr16xx/mmw. The
 *   resource file in this demo is mmw_res.h, this file shows all the definitions
 *   that are needed by the DPC from the application. This file is provided
 *   on compiler command line when building as follows:
 *   @verbatim --define=APP_RESOURCE_FILE="<ti/demo/xwr16xx/mmw/mmw_res.h>" @endverbatim
 *
 *   As seen in application execution flow, 2 options are given in objdetdsp DPC chain.
 *   - **Full DPC chain** with Range DPU, Doppler DPU , CFARCA DPU and AoA DPU.
 *        This is the default configuration. DPC accepts frameStart and chirpEvent(trigger DPC execution) from DPM. All DPUs
 *        will be excuted during DPC execution(@ref DPC_ObjectDetection_execute).
 *
 *   - **DPC without Range DPU**
 *        This option is enabled by compiler option defined as follows:
 *        @verbatim --define=OBJDET_NO_RANGE @endverbatim
 *        DPC accepts frameStart and data injection(trigger DPC execution) from DPM. All doppler DPU, cfarca DPU and AoA DPU will be
 *        executed during DPC execution(@ref DPC_ObjectDetection_execute).
 *   
 *  @section objdetdsp_memory Data Memory
 *
 *  @subsection objdetdsp_memCfg Memory configuration
 *   The configuration of L3 and Core Local L2 and L1 RAM (hitherto referred in short as LRAM)
 *   memories are provided by the application 
 *      - @ref DPC_ObjectDetection_InitParams_t::L3ramCfg,
 *      - @ref DPC_ObjectDetection_InitParams_t::CoreL1RamCfg and 
 *      - @ref DPC_ObjectDetection_InitParams_t::CoreL2RamCfg 
 *
 *   during @ref DPC_ObjectDetection_init (invoked by application through @ref DPM_init). 
 *   This configuration is the default memory configuration for the DPC.
 *
 *   This DPC can also accept share memory(L3 RAM) configuraiton during processing of 
 *   @ref DPC_OBJDET_IOCTL__STATIC_PRE_START_CFG command. This is used for option 2 of execution flow when range DPU is
 *   disabled and radarCube memory is allocated outside of this DPC. 
 *   
 *   @subsection objdetdsp_memPar Memory partition
 *   The L3 and LRAM partition happens during the processing of @ref DPC_OBJDET_IOCTL__STATIC_PRE_START_CFG command
 *   and is shown in the following figure. The allocation from application system heap
 *   (typically in LRAM) using the MemoryP_osal API is done during @ref DPC_ObjectDetection_init
 *   (object instances of DPC and DPUs for all sub-frames) and during the
 *   processing of @ref DPC_OBJDET_IOCTL__STATIC_PRE_START_COMMON_CFG command (range DPUs
 *   dc antenna coupling signature buffer that is unique for each sub-frame)
 *   is also shown in the figure.
 *
 *
 *   @image html memory_allocation.png "Data memory allocation"
 *
 *   In the above picture, the L2 RAM shows allocation
 *   of the "cfarRngDopSnrList" (@ref DPIF_CFARDetList_t) outside of scratch usage
 *   as this is shared buffer between CFAR and AoA in the processing flow and
 *   therefore needs to persist within the sub-frame until AoA is executed at the
 *   end of the processing chain.
 *
 *   The buffers labeled "windowBuffer" and "twiddle Buffer" in the picture
 *   for range, doppler and AoA DPUs are allocated/generated during DPU configue time.
 *   AoA DPU needs the same "windowBuffer" and "twiddle Buffer" as used in doppler DPU to recompute the 2D
 *   doppler FFT, hence the same 2D windowing and twiddle buffers are provided to AoA DPU as well.
 *   
 *   In DPC, these "windowBuffer" and "twiddle buffer" are allocated in persistent memory(not overlapping with scratch
 *   buffers). This arrangement in memory makes the 2D window/twiddle sharable between Doppler and AoA DPUs.
 *   It also prevents window/twiddle buffer re-generation across frame boundary in non-advanced
 *   frame scenarios.
 *
 *   The AoA DPU API has been designed to require 2D-FFT window and twiddle buffer configuration
 *   (i.e configuration is not optional) because it may be used in contexts (unit test, other DPC flavors) where doppler 
 *   processing may not exist.
 *   The AoA interface buffers are consumed by the application at the end of the
 *   DPC execute API.
 * 
 *
 *   @subsection objdetdsp_reconfig DPU reconfiguration 
 *   DPU reconfiguration is related to data path processing across sub-frames for advanced frame configuraiton.
 *   In such cases, reconfiguration is required when switching sub-frames because scratch buffers and EDMA resources 
 *   are overlapped across sub-frames. Note that the DPU's xxx_config API
 *   is a full configuration API beyond the EDMA resources configuration (e.g static
 *   and dynamic configuration) so restricting to the full configuration
 *   would imply that no sub-frame specific DPU instantiation is necessary. However, the code illustrates separate 
 *   instances of DPUs for each sub-frame to demonstrate generality of the sub-frame solution,
 *   in the case where there may be specialized (partial) configuration APIs in an
 *   optimized implementation (that only configured the overlapped EDMA resources).
 *   The limiting to full configuration also means that all the code required to build the
 *   configuration structures of the DPUs during the pre-start config time either
 *   has to be repeated or alternatively, the configurations that were created
 *   during the pre-start config processing be saved and reused later.
 *   The latter path has been taken, all DPU configuration that is built
 *   during the pre-start processing is stored in separate storage, this can be
 *   located at @ref SubFrameObj_t::dpuCfg. However, parts of this reconfiguration that
 *   cannot be captured in this storage need to be repeated, namely, window generation
 *   (@ref DPC_ObjDetDSP_GenRangeWindow) and rx phase compensation
 *   (@ref DPC_ObjDetDSP_GetRxChPhaseComp).
 *
 *   The DPU top-level dynamic configuration structure contains
 *   pointers to the individual configurations (e.g see @ref DPU_AoAProc_DynamicConfig_t)
 *   so DPC stores the dynamic configuration in pre-start config (@ref DPC_ObjectDetection_DynCfg_t)
 *   in permanent storage (@ref SubFrameObj_t::dynCfg) and DPUs are passed from this storage area
 *   so that their pointers point to this permanent storage during reconfiguration.
 *   The static configuration during pre-start config (@ref DPC_ObjectDetection_StaticCfg_t)
 *   is also stored (@ref SubFrameObj_t::staticCfg) for convenient referencing when doing
 *   range bias and rx phase measurement (@ref DPC_ObjDetDSP_rangeBiasRxChPhaseMeasure)
 *   and the above referred rx ch phase computation during reconfiguration (@ref DPC_ObjDetDSP_GetRxChPhaseComp).
 *   Saving this entire static configuration is probably more than necessary (versus
 *   storing only the parameters that need to be referred in the above mentioned functions)
 *   but it keeps implementation simpler/cleaner and may be useful in debugging.
 *
 *  @section objdetdsp_calibration Range Bias and Rx Channel Gain/Offset Measurement and Compensation
 *
 *    Because of imperfections in antenna layouts on the board, RF delays in SOC, etc,
 *    there is need to calibrate the sensor to compensate for bias in the range estimation and
 *    receive channel gain and phase imperfections. The DPC provides the ability to
 *    do the measurement and compensation.
 *
 *    @anchor Figure_calibration
 *    @image html calibration.png "Range Bias and Rx Channel Gain/Offset Measurement and Compensation"
 *
 *   @subsection objdetdsp_measurement Measurement
 *     If the measurement (@ref DPC_ObjectDetection_MeasureRxChannelBiasCfg_t::enabled) is enabled in pre-start
 *     common config (@ref DPC_ObjectDetection_PreStartCommonCfg_t::measureRxChannelBiasCfg)
 *     or dynamic config (@ref DPC_OBJDET_IOCTL__DYNAMIC_MEASURE_RANGE_BIAS_AND_RX_CHAN_PHASE),
 *     it is assumed that a strong target like a corner reflector is kept at boresight at
 *     a distance of X = @ref DPC_ObjectDetection_MeasureRxChannelBiasCfg_t::targetDistance.
 *     Peak search is done after the 2D FFT in the 0th Doppler
 *     of the detection matrix within distance D = @ref DPC_ObjectDetection_MeasureRxChannelBiasCfg_t::searchWinSize
 *     around X i.e peak is searched between -D/2 + X and X + D/2.
 *     The peak position is then used to compute the
 *     square root of the sum of the magnitude squares of the virtual antennas
 *     (taken from 1D-FFT Radar Cube matrix) for the
 *     peak and its two nearest neighbors. These three magnitudes and their positions
 *     are used to do parabolic interpolation to find the more accurate peak location from
 *     which the range bias is estimated as this interpolated peak position minus
 *     the configured target distance X.
 *     The rx channel phase and gain estimation is done by finding the minimum
 *     of the magnitude squared of the virtual antennas and this minimum is used
 *     to scale the individual antennas so that the magnitude of the coefficients is
 *     always less than or equal to 1. Rx channel compensation coefficients are
 *     calculated according to following equations. The radar cube matrix is
 *     laid out as four dimensional matrix defined as @ref DPIF_RADARCUBE_FORMAT_1, i.e. as
 *       \f[
 *           \mbox{RadarCube}[\mbox{numTxPatterns}][\mbox{numDopplerChirps}][\mbox{numRxAnt}][\mbox{numRangeBins}]
 *       \f]
 *
 *     The received symbols are extracted from the 1D-FFT radar cube from the first chirp
 *     at the range index \f$i_{Max}\f$corresponding to the maximum in the searched range as
 *
 *       \f[
 *           x(i_{Tx},i_{Rx}) = \mbox{RadarCube}(i_{Tx},0,i_{Rx},i_{Max}), \;\;\;\; i_{Tx}=0,...,N_{TxAnt}-1, \;\;\;\; i_{Rx}=0,...,N_{RxAnt}-1
 *       \f]
 *
 *     The coefficients are calculated as
 *
 *       \f[
 *           c(i_{Tx},i_{Rx}) = \frac{x^*(i_{Tx},i_{Rx})}{|x(i_{Tx},i_{Rx})|^2}\;x_{Min}, \;\;\;\; i_{Tx}=0,...,N_{TxAnt}-1, \;\;\;\; i_{Rx}=0,...,N_{RxAnt}-1
 *       \f]
 *
 *     where
 *
 *       \f[
 *           x_{Min} = \min{|x(i_{Tx},i_{Rx})|}
 *       \f]
 *
 *     In the above calculations, the division by magnitude squared for each element
 *     achieves the gain compensation part i.e equalizes the different tx-rx path gains --
 *     during compensation (@ref objdetdsp_compensation), when the input antenna samples
 *     are multiplied with their corresponding above coefficients,
 *     the result has the same magnitude for all virtual antennas. Similarly,
 *     the multiplication by complex conjugate achieves phase compensation. The use of minimum
 *     of the data set allows for maximal utilization of the 16-bits of fixed point precision
 *     to represent the coefficients -- the compensation vector will have unity amplitude for the
 *     minimum element and less than unity for the rest.
 *     The compensation rx coefficients are in Q15 format.
 *     Refer to the function @ref DPC_ObjDetDSP_rangeBiasRxChPhaseMeasure
 *     which performs the measurements, the measurement
 *     result (@ref DPU_AoAProc_compRxChannelBiasCfg_t) is given out of the DPC
 *     to the application as part of the result structure produced by DPC's execute
 *     API (@ref DPC_ObjectDetection_ExecuteResult_t::compRxChanBiasMeasurement).
 *
 *   @subsection objdetdsp_compensation Compensation
 *     When compensation configuration (DPU_AoAProc_compRxChannelBiasCfg_t) is provided as part of
 *     pre-start common config (@ref DPC_ObjectDetection_PreStartCommonCfg_t::compRxChanCfg) or
 *     dynamic config (@ref DPC_OBJDET_IOCTL__DYNAMIC_COMP_RANGE_BIAS_AND_RX_CHAN_PHASE),
 *     as seen in figure @ref Figure_calibration, for each sub-frame the DPC
 *     determines the rx compensation vector (@ref  DPC_ObjDetDSP_GetRxChPhaseComp) to apply
 *     for that sub-frame (the resulting compensation vector is such that
 *     all antennas enabled for that configuration are contiguous in storage)
 *     depending on the antenna configuration for that sub-frame and passes this to the
 *     AoA DPU. During processing, AoA DPU will apply this contiguously stored vector
 *     on the virtual antenna array before performing angle computation.
 *
 *     @note Although the range bias estimation is immune to motion because
 *       the bias estimation is based on searching peak position after 2D FFT,
 *       the rx compensation coefficients are calculated from 1D FFT output,
 *       so this will not be immune to motion in the scene. Hence, during calibration
 *       care must exercised to ensure that there are no moving objects in the search
 *       window range.

 * @brief This commands indicates to the DPC that the results DPC provided to the application

 *        have been exported/consumed. The purpose of this command is for DPC to
 *        reclaim the memory resources associated with the results. The DPC may
 *        also perform sub-frame switching, and do error-checking to see
 *        if export was later than expected e.g the DPC design may be such that
 *        the previous frame/sub-frame's export notification may need to come
 *        after a new frame/sub-frame (this is the case currently with this
 *        object detection DPC). The DPC will also consider this command as a
 *        signal from the application that all its processing for the current frame/sub-frame
 *        has been done and so if a new frame/sub-frame interrupt (DPC has registered
 *        a frame interrupt with the DPM) comes before the last step in the
 *        processing of this command (which could be sub-frame switching and
 *        preparing for next sub-frame/frame), then the DPC will signal an assert
 *        to the application from its frame interrupt. The expected sequence is
 *        the following:
 *
 *        1. App consumes the process result of the DPC (e.g sending output on UART).
 *        2. App performs any dynamic configuration command processing by issuing DPC's
 *           IOCTL APIs for the next frame/sub-frame.
 *        3. App issues this result-exported IOCTL.
 *        4. DPC does its processing related to this IOCTL in the following sequence:
 *            a. May do error checking and preparing for next sub-frame/frame.
 *            b. Do book-keeping related to marking this as end of sub-frame/frame processing
 *               by the app. The DPC's registered frame start interrupt performs
 *               check on this information to see if next frame/sub-frame came before
 *               this end of processing in which case it will issue an assert to app.
