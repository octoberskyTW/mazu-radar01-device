/** @mainpage Object Detection Data-path Processing Chain (DPC) for range HWA DPU only
 * [TOC]
 *  @section objdetrangehwa_intro Overview
 *
 *  The Object detection DPC provides the functionality of processing ADC samples during
 *  the frame acquisition periods. It can be used by an application by registering with the DPM
 *  framework and invoked using DPM APIs. The external interface of this Object detection
 *  DPC can be seen at @ref DPC_OBJDETRANGEHWA_EXTERNAL
 *
 *   @image html object_detection_datapath.png "Object Detection Data Path Processing Chain"
 *   \n
 *   \n
 *   This data path chain processing consists of:
 *   - Processing during the chirps as seen in the timing diagram:
 *     - This consists of 1D (range) FFT processing using HWA that takes input from multiple
 *     receive antennas from the ADC buffer for every chirp (corresponding to the
 *     chirping pattern on the transmit antennas) and performs FFT on it and generates 
 *     radar cube output into the L3 RAM in the format defined by @ref DPIF_RADARCUBE_FORMAT_1. 
 *   For more details of range processing, see the doxygen
 *     documentation of range processing DPU (Data Path Unit) located at \ref dpu_range_intro
 *
 *  @section objdetrangehwa_appdpcFlow Application-DPC Execution Flow
 *   Following diagram shows the application-DPC execution Flow.
 *
 *  @image html dpc_flow.png "Application-DPC Execution Flow"
 *
 *   The flow above shows the sequencing of initialization, configuration, execution and
 *   dynamic control operations of the DPC and some level of detail of
 *   what happens under these operations.
 *   Most of the hardware resource (e.g HWA and EDMA related) configuration
 *   for the DPUs that is issued by the DPC as part of processing
 *   @ref DPC_OBJDETRANGEHWA_IOCTL__STATIC_PRE_START_CFG commands is provided by the
 *   application at build time using a resource file (DPC sources are built
 *   as part of building the application, there is no separate DPC library object).
 *   This file is passed as a compiler command line define
 *   @verbatim --define=APP_RESOURCE_FILE="fileName" @endverbatim The "fileName"
 *   above includes the path as if to include the file when building the the DPC sources
 *   as part of building the application, and any DPC source that needs to refer
 *   to this file (currently objdetrangehwa.c) has the following code
 *    @verbatim #include APP_RESOURCE_FILE @endverbatim
 *   One of the demos that uses this DPC is located at ti/demo/xwr68xx/mmw. The
 *   resource file in this demo is mmw_res.h, this file shows all the definitions
 *   that are needed by the DPC from the application. This file is provided
 *   on compiler command line when building as follows:
 *   @verbatim --define=APP_RESOURCE_FILE="<ti/demo/xwr68xx/mmw/mmw_res.h>" @endverbatim
 *
 *   
 *  @section objdetrangehwa_memory Data Memory
 *
 *  @subsection objdetrangehwa_memCfg Memory configuration
 *   The configuration of L3 and Core Local RAM (hitherto referred in short as LRAM)
 *   memories are provided by the application 
 *      - @ref DPC_ObjectDetectionRangeHWA_InitParams_t::L3ramCfg,
 *      - @ref DPC_ObjectDetectionRangeHWA_InitParams_t::CoreLocalRamCfg
 *
 *   during @ref DPC_ObjectDetection_init (invoked by application through @ref DPM_init). 
 *
 *   This DPC reports L3RAM and radarCube memory usage back to application to be used by other DPCs
 *   (for details, refer to @ref DPC_ObjectDetectionRangeHWA_preStartCfg_radarCubeMem_t and 
 *   @ref DPC_ObjectDetectionRangeHWA_preStartCfg_memUsage_t)
 *
 *   @subsection objdetrangehwa_memPar Memory partition
 *   The L3 and LRAM partition happens during the processing of @ref DPC_OBJDETRANGEHWA_IOCTL__STATIC_PRE_START_CFG command
 *   and is shown in the following figure. The allocation from application system heap
 *   (typically in LRAM) using the MemoryP_osal API is done during @ref DPC_ObjectDetection_init
 *   (object instances of DPC and DPUs for all sub-frames) and during the
 *   processing of @ref DPC_OBJDETRANGEHWA_IOCTL__STATIC_PRE_START_COMMON_CFG command (range DPUs
 *   dc antenna coupling signature buffer that is unique for each sub-frame)
 *   is also shown in the figure.
 *
 *
 *   @image html memory_allocation.png "Data memory allocation"
 *
 *   The buffers labeled "windowBuffer" in the picture are allocated/generated during DPU configue time.
 *   The windowing coefficients will be copied to HWA internal memory, hence this is temporary use of the local memory.
 *
 *   @subsection objdetrangehwa_reconfig DPU reconfiguration 
 *   DPU reconfiguration is related to data path processing across sub-frames for advanced frame configuraiton.
 *   In such cases, reconfiguration is required when switching sub-frames because HWA and EDMA resources
 *   are overlapped across sub-frames. Note that the DPU's xxx_config API
 *   is a full configuration API beyond the HWA and EDMA resources configuration (e.g static
 *   and dynamic configuration) so restricting to the full configuration
 *   would imply that no sub-frame specific DPU instantiation is necessary. However, the code illustrates separate 
 *   instances of DPUs for each sub-frame to demonstrate generality of the sub-frame solution,
 *   in the case where there may be specialized (partial) configuration APIs in an
 *   optimized implementation (that only configured the overlapped HWA and EDMA resources).
 *   The limiting to full configuration also means that all the code required to build the
 *   configuration structures of the DPUs during the pre-start config time either
 *   has to be repeated or alternatively, the configurations that were created
 *   during the pre-start config processing be saved and reused later.
 *   The latter path has been taken, all DPU configuration that is built
 *   during the pre-start processing is stored in separate storage, this can be
 *   located at @ref SubFrameObj_t::rangeCfg. However, parts of this reconfiguration that
 *   cannot be captured in this storage need to be repeated, namely, window generation
 *   (@ref DPC_ObjDetRangeHwa_GenRangeWindow).
 *
 *  @section objdetrangehwa_designNotes Data Path Design Notes
 *
 *    @subsection objdetrangehwa_scaling Scaling
 *      -# HWA FFT Scaling: The HWA uses 24-bit fixed point arithmetic for the data path processing.
 *      In order to prevent overflows in the FFT processing, the scaling factors have to be
 *      set appropriately in the HWA configuration. The HWA has up to 10 stages of processing
 *      with ability to scale by 1/2 for each stage.
 *          -# 1D processing: If the HWA's FFT scale is set to \f$\frac{1}{2^k}\f$
 *          where \f$k\f$ is the combined value for (number of stages for which the scaling is enabled) 
 *          and (right shift applied in output formatter) and input to the FFT were a pure tone at one of the bins, then
 *          the output magnitude of the FFT at that bin will be \f$\frac{N}{2^k}\f$ (\f$N\f$ is the FFT order) times
 *          the input tone amplitude (because tone is complex, this implies that the individual real and
 *          imaginary components will also be amplified by a maximum of this scale).
 *          Because we do a Blackman window before the FFT, the overall scale is about 1/2.4 of the FFT scale.
 *          This means for example for 256 point FFT, the windowing + FFT scale will be \f$\frac{106.7}{2^k}\f$. 
 *          For example k=2, this will be 26.7. Therefore, the ADC output when it is a pure tone should not exceed 
 *          +/-2^15/26.7 = 1228 for the I and Q components (even though HWA is internally 24-bit, the FFT output is stored
 *          as 16-bit before 2D processing, hence 2^15). For example k=3, this will be 13.33. 
 *          Therefore, the ADC output when it is a pure tone should not exceed 
 *          +/-2^15/13.33  = 2458 for the I and Q components (even though HWA is internally 24-bit, the FFT output is stored
 *          as 16-bit before 2D processing, hence 2^15). So chosen value of 'k' can now be distributed between 
 *          butterfly scaling and output divisor (right) shift using via \ref DPC_ObjectDetectionRangeHWA_StaticCfg_t::rangeFFTtuning. \n
 *          Recommendation is to allow butterfly stages to grow to 24-bit without using scaling and apply scaling
 *          at appropriate butterfly stages using \ref DPU_RangeProcHWA_FFTtuning::numLastButterflyStagesToScale 
 *          only if there is a possibility of overflowing 24-bit at that particular stage and beyond. 
 *          Next, to convert 24-bit to 16-bit, use \ref DPU_RangeProcHWA_FFTtuning::fftOutputDivShift appropriately.\n
 *          The XWR68xx EVM when presented with a strong single reflector
 *          reasonably close to it (with Rx dB gain of 30 dB in the chirp profile and ADC samples = 256)
 *          shows ADC samples to be a max of about 2000 and hence application could chose value of '3'
 *          for fftOutputDivShift and value of '0' for numLastButterflyStagesToScale.
 *      -# Scaling factors for the chain: See ti/datapath/dpc/objectdetection/common/docs/object_detection_data_scaling.xlsx
