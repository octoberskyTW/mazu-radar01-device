     *  ======== CacheDesc ========
     *  Structure used by ICpuDataSheet implementations to
     *  specify device cache modes.
     *
     *  A map is defined by an ICpuDataSheet implementation
     *  that maps a string denoting a device register setting
     *  to a CacheDesc structure. This maybe used in implementing
     *  the 'getMemoryMap' method. An example of such a map is shown below :
     *
     *   readonly config ti.catalog.c7000.ICacheInfo.CacheDesc cacheMap[string] =  [
         *    ['l1PMode',{desc:"L1P Cache",
