 *  The link below provides SYS/BIOS C28x register usage information:
 *
 *      {@link ./doc-files/c28regconv.html SYS/BIOS C28x Register Usage}
 *
 *! Open Issues:
 *  @p(blist)
 *      - System_printf() issue. Args need to be cast as UInt16
 *      - PLL not set ot 150MHz. Who whould do this? Gel OK?
 *      - Disable watchdog. Gel OK?
 *      - Hwi needs to be revisited wrt PIE
 *      - Task stack should be in lower memory. How to ensure?
 *      - Testcases need x28 specific config to build
 *      - UArg data type is different in SYS/BIOS 6 compared to DSP/BIOS 5.20.
 *      Old was Void *, New is intptr_t. Old was treated by codegen
 *      as a pointer and passed in XAR regs. New is treated as 32 bit 
 *      data and passed in ACC. Effects Task_glue().
