 * Here is a pseudo image of the initial MSP430 task stack:
 *
 *    R4
 *    R5
 *    R6
 *    R7
 *    R8
 *    R9
 *    R10
 *    SR
 *    glue
 *    arg0
 *    arg1
 *    fxn
 *    exit
 *    enter
 *
 * The top of the initial stack consists of the registers that are preserved
 * by a called C function as defined by the C compiler. These are the
 * registers pushed and popped by TaskSupport_swap.
 *
 * Just below these registers is the status register (SR), and the address of
 * the 'glue' function (more on this in a moment).
 *
 * The Task enter() function (held at the bottom of stack) sets up the
 * first invocation of the task in the same manner as if it had been "returned"
 * to from Task_restore(), which is the normal path back to an unblocked task.
 * When Task enter() is returned from, the address of the 'glue' function is
 * popped; this function will pop the two UArgs below it on the stack into
 * the appropriate registers for a "fxn(arg0, arg1)" call, and then return
 * into the task's function (fxn) below it on the stack.
 *
 * The TaskSupport_swap() function pushes all the saved-by-callee
 * registers onto the task stack, then saves the updated SP into
 * the "old" task object's context (SP) address passed to it. Then it
 * loads the "new" task object's context (SP) (the second arg passed
 * to swap) into the SP, unrolls the saved registers and returns into
 * the new task.
 *
 * Below the Task's function address on the stack is the Task_exit()
 * function address which is returned into if the task function falls
 * out the bottom.
 *
 * The pointer returned by the buildTaskStack function is the task's initial
 * stack pointer. This address is stored into the task object's context
 * field and is passed to the TaskSupport_swap() function later.
