 *  ======== SysSemihost ========
 *  Implementation of `{@link xdc.runtime.ISystemSupport}` using
 *  ANSI C Standard Library
 *
 *  This implementation provides a fully functional implementation of
 *  all methods specified by `ISystemSupport`. As with all
 *  `ISystemSupport` modules, this module is the back-end for the
 *  `{@link xdc.runtime.System}` module.
 *
 *  This implementation relies on the target's runtime support libraries
 *  (i.e. `fflush()` and `putchar()`). Therefore the  functions are re-entrant
 *  (thread-safe) if the underlying rts library is re-entrant.
