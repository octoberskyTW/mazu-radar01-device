 *  This package builds a library of standard XDC system support functions.
 *  In particular, it builds several implementations of the
 *  xdc.runtime.ISystemProvider interface.  Moreover, this package uses sources
 *  that are part of the xdc.runtime package (to avoid having multiple copies
 *  of the same source in different runtime support packages for different
 *  ISAs.
