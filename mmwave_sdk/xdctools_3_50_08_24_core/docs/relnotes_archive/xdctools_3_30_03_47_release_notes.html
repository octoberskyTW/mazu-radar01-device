<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>RTSC / XDC (eXpanDed C) is a standard for reusable software components, 
optimized for real-time embedded systems. RTSC components have hardware-neutral 
formal interfaces, are configurable offline to optimize memory and performance, 
and support custom automation in the development environment via a scripting 
language.</p>
<p>The XDCtools product includes the following components: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Core (<code>xdc.*</code>)</b> -
the <code><b>xdc</b></code> and <code><b>xs</b></code> command line utilities for 
building packages and executing scripts respectively; packages that implement 
the RTSC standard;</li>
<li><b>User tools (<code>xdc.tools.*</code>)</b>
- command-line and graphical utilities for working with packages and
repositories;</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eclipse
(</span><b><code>eclipse</code></b><span style="font-weight: bold;">)</span>
- A set of integration plugins for RTSC for the eclipse platform.
These plugins are leveraged by Code Composer Studio (CCS) to provide
support for RTSC content in an integrated development environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>XDCtools releases prior to release 3.30 also included the following
components:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Targets (<code>*.targets.*</code>)</b>
    - definitions for using various TI and third-party compiler tool chains;</li>
  <li><b>Platforms (<code>*.platforms.*</code>)</b>
    - definitions for linking and running code on various TI and third-party
    board-level hardware and simulator products.</li>
</ul>
For more information about where these components are
now available, see the <a href="#Compatibility">Upgrade &amp;
    Compatibility Information</a> section below.

<h2><a name="Compatibility">Upgrade and Compatibility
    Information</a></h2>
<h3>Code Composer Studio (CCS)</h3>
  <p><span style="color:red">XDCtools 3.30 should only be used in CCS
      6.x (or above).</span>  Installation into CCS 5.5 (or earlier) will
    necessitate a re-installation of CCS 5.5.</p>
  <p>XDCtools 3.30 releases are no longer released in an installer,
    they are simply provided as <tt>.zip</tt> files which can be extracted
    into any directory that CCS uses to discover new products
    (e.g., <tt>c:/ti</tt>).</p>
  <p><strong>Note for Windows users:</strong>  When you unzip an
    XDCtools release using Windows Explorer simply double click
    on the <tt>.zip</tt> file and drag the single top-level folder it
    contains to the folder containing <tt>ccsv6/</tt> (typically
    <tt>c:/ti</tt>).  If, instead, you right-click the <tt>.zip</tt>
    file and select "Extract All ...", Windows Explorer adds the
    name of the zip file itself to the default output folder.
    <em>Do not use this output name</em>.  You must extract the
    <em>contents</em> of the zip file into, say, <tt>c:/ti</tt>, 
    <em>not</em> a new folder named after the zip file itself.</p>

<h3>Deleted Content</h3>
  <p>Beginning with the 3.30 release, all embedded targets and platforms
    have been removed from the default release (a.k.a. the "Core"
    release) so they can be delivered with middleware products, such
    as <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/ti-rtos">TI-RTOS</a>
    and <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/grace">Grace</a>, that have
    dependencies only on specific targets and platforms.  This has
    the advantage of greatly reducing the size of XDtools for users
    who are only interested in a relatively small number of embedded
    architectures.  But, it also <span style="color:red">breaks compatibility</span>
    for users who expect to always have their favorite architecture's 
    support included in XDCtools releases.</p>
  <p>To simplify the migration to this new distribution and to support
  size reduced installations, XDCtools 3.30 is
  <a href="http://downloads.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/rtsc/">available</a> 
  in several different release bundles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>XDCtools Core</b>: the default release that does not
      include any embedded targets or platforms.  This release is 100% 
      self contained and can be used in virtually any development 
      environment: standalone command line based environments as well
      as in non-Java based GUI IDEs.</li>
    <li> <b>XDCtools Core - JRE</b>: the the same as
      <b>XDCtools Core</b> <i>but without</i> an included Java Runtime
      Environment (JRE).  This bundle is significantly smaller but, in
      order to use this release at the command line, it also requires
      the user to set the environment
      variable <tt>XDCTOOLS_JAVA_HOME</tt> to the installation directory of
      either an existing JRE or Java Developers Kit (JDK).
      <br/><strong>Note:</strong> If this release is only used within CCS, there is no need 
      to define <tt>XDCTOOLS_JAVA_HOME</tt>; CCS automatically defines
      this variable to reference the JRE that CCS provides
      (&lt;ccs_installation_directory&gt;/<tt>ccsv6/eclipse/jre</tt>).</li>
    <li> <b>Legacy XDCtools</b>: as with prior releases of XDCtools,
      this release is wrapped in an installer and includes
      both <b>XDCtools Core</b> and all TI supported embedded targets and
      platforms along with their pre-built libraries.  This bundle
      will be eliminated in a subsequent XDCtools release. </li>
  </ul>
<h3>Target Runtime APIs</h3>
  <p><b>The <tt>xdc.runtime</tt> package</b>: As part of the effort to enable <tt>xdc.runtime</tt> to more
    easily fit into the ROM of most devices
    (<a target="_blank" href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=424399">Bug 424399</a>),
    several significant optimizations had to be made made that break strict binary 
    compatibility with target content libraries built with XDCtools 3.25.x (or earlier).  
    In particular, target content built against XDCtools 3.25.x <tt>xdc.runtime</tt>
    can be 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>used without rebuilding provided it does not include any modules that 
    inherit from an interface defined by <tt>xdc.runtime</tt></li>
    <li>rebuilt against XDCtools 3.30.x <tt>xdc.runtime</tt> without any source code changes</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Deprecated types</b>: To reduce conflicts with target content
    produced by other groups, the deprecated types <tt>Uns</tt>, <tt>Uint</tt>, 
    <tt>Uint16</tt>, etc. are no longer defined by default.  If you still
    need to use these types, you must now define the
    symbol <tt>xdc__deprecated_types</tt> when compiling sources that 
    reference these types.
    See <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=425917">Bug
      425917</a> for details.
  </p>
<h3>Package Compatibility</h3>
  <p><b>Package internal files</b>: All generated package internal files
    are backwards compatible starting from XDCtools 3.20.  So, packages
    created using XDCtools 3.20 or later can be consumed using
    this release.  Because of the addition of the target
    type <code>CString</code> to XDCtools 3.25.x, packages created with this release that
    contain non-metaonly modules cannot be used with XDCtools 
    releases earlier than XDCtools 3.25.x.  This includes the <code>xdc.runtime</code> package.
    See <a href="http://rtsc.eclipse.org/docs-tip/XDCtools_Internal_Version_Numbers">XDCtools Internal Version Numbers</a> for additional details.</p>

  <p><b>Package-specific APIs</b>: Each package
    has a compatibility key defined in its <b><code>package.xdc</code></b>
    specification file.  No package compatibility keys were changed in this
    release.
  </p>
  <p>Please note that the package compatibility keys are
    independent of XDCtools product release numbers (described in 
    <a href="#Version">Versioning</a> below).  Package compatibility keys:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Enable tooling to identify incompatibilities between components, and</li>
    <li>Convey end-user requirements when re-integrating specific components.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Package compatibility keys are composed of 4 comma-delimited numbers -
    M, S, R, P - where: </p>
  <ul>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>M = Major
	-</b> A difference in M indicates a break in compatibility. The 
      package consumer is required to re-write its source code in order to
      use the package.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>S = Source 
	-</b> A difference in S indicates source compatibility.
      The package consumer's source code doesn't require change, but
      <i>does</i> require a recompile.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>R = Radix
	-</b> A difference in R indicates an introduction of new features, but 
      compatibility with previous interfaces is not broken. If libraries are 
      provided by the package, an application must re-link with the
      new libraries, but is not required to recompile its source.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>P = Patch
	-</b>A difference in P indicates that only bugs
      have been fixed in the latest package and no new features have
      been introduced.  If libraries are provided by the package, an 
      application must re-link with the new libraries, but is not
      required to recompile its source.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><a href="#XDC_TOP">back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="Host_Support">Host Support</a></h2>
  <p>This release supports the following hosts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8</li>
    <li>Suse Linux Enterprise Server 10 and Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS. Note that IDE
      integration on Linux is only supported for CCSv6 on
      Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS</li>
  </ul>
  <p><a href="#XDC_TOP">back to top</a></p>
  <hr/>
<h2><a name="Dependencies">Dependencies</a></h2>
  <p>With the exception of a C compiler, XDCtools is a fully
    self-contained set of development tools to create, build, run, and monitor
    embedded target content.  If you use
    any of the tool sets listed below, you should use the version
    named in order to successfully use this version of XDCtools:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Code Composer Studio 6.0 (or later):
      <span style="color:red">XDCtools 3.30 (or later) cannot be used in CCS 5.x.</span></li>
    <li>TI C6x Code Generation Tools version 7.4.7 or compatible</li>
    <li>TI ARM Code Generation Tools version 5.1.0 or compatible</li>
    <li>TI MSP430 Code Generation Tools version 4.3.1 or compatible</li>
    <li>TI C28x Code Generation Tools version 6.2.5 or compatible</li>
    <li>GCC for x86 version 4.7.0 or compatible</li>
    <li>GCC for ARM version 4.4.0 or compatible</li>
  </ul>
  <p><a href="#XDC_TOP">back to top</a></p>
  <hr/>
<h2><a name="Device_Support">Device Support</a></h2>
  <p>Starting with release 3.30, each release of XDCtools is
  available in one of several distribution bundles each supporting a varying
  number of device families.  This allows products (such as CCS) to
  selectively embed a distribution that is as small as possible.</p>
  <p> The "Core" distribution (identified by the "_core" qualifier in
  installation directory name) has no embedded device support.  As a
  result, "Core" users must either use another product (such
  as <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/ti-rtos">TI-RTOS 2.0</a>)
  which includes any necessary device support or explicitly add a repository
  containing the desired device support to the package path of their
  projects.</p>
  <p> The "full" distribution (identified by the lack of any qualifier
  in the installation directory name) supports the following device 
  families:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>C6000 family - C674, C67P, C64P, C66, C64T</li>
    <li>C2000 family - C28</li>
    <li>ARM processors - TMS470, ARM7/9, Cortex A8/M3/R4</li>
    <li>MSP430</li>
    <li>Native development host (Windows, Linux)</li>
  </ul>
