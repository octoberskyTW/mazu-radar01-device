/* Linker templates are passed the following arguments:
 *      $out        - an open file stream for the generated linker
 *                    command file
 *      $args[]     - array of zero or more libraries that should be linked

 *  The linker used on the mac is LLVM which does not accept linker
 *  comand files.  However, the gcc target passes this file to the compiler
 *  via '@' so that we can provide the list of libraries with which to link.
