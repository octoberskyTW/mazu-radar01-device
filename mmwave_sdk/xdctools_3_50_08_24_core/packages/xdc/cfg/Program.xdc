 *  ======== Program ========
 *  The Program object for the configuration object model.
 *
 *  This module defines the "root" of the configuration object model; all
 *  "top-level" configuration settings for the executable are provided by
 *  this object. Program configuration scripts reference this module via the
 *  global variable `Program`; i.e., `Program` is implicitly initialized as
 *  follows:
 *  @p(code)
 *      var Program = xdc.useModule('xdc.cfg.Program');
 *  @p
 *
 *  After a configuration script completes successfully, the following files
 *  are generated:
 *  @p(nlist)
 *	- package/cfg/<exe_name>.c
 *	- package/cfg/<exe_name>.xdl
 *  @p
 *  where `<exe_name>` is the name of the executable with the final '.'
 *  character replaced with an '_'.
 *
 *  The generated C file contains code and data from each module used by the
 *  program and must be compiled and linked with the other sources to
 *  produce the final executable.  The generated linker command file must also
 *  be added during this final link step.
 *
 *  The linker command file is produced by expanding a template
 *  provided by the platform specifed during configuration and contains
 *  hardware and compiler specific directives required by the target modules
 *  that are part of the program's configuration.  This template expands
 *  other templates specified by each imported package's
 *  `{@link xdc.IPackage#getSects getSects}` method, for example. This allows
 *  each package participating in the configuration executable to
 *  automatically contribute a portion of the executable's linker command
 *  file.
 *
 *  You can modify or augment the contents of this file via
 *  `{@link xdc.cfg.Program#sectionsExclude sectionsExclude}` and
 *  `{@link xdc.cfg.Program#sectionsTemplate sectionsTemplate}`. It is even
 *  possible to completely replace the template used to generate this file via
 *  `{@link xdc.cfg.Program#linkTemplate linkTemplate}`. If a custom template
 *  is used, it should still invoke `{@link xdc.IPackage#getSects getSects}`
 *  methods for all loaded packages.
 *  These configuration options provide the user complete control of the linker
 *  command file.

     *  ======== sectMap ========
     *  A section name to SectionSpec mapping

     *  This is a program specific mapping of output section names to

     *  names to memory names; see {@link xdc.platform.IPlatform#sectMap}.
     *
     *  This parameter enables program configurations to place named
     *  sections in platform specific memory regions.  During generation of
     *  the linker command file, sections are mapped to named memories by

     *  the target classifies each section as either "code", "data" or
     *  "stack" {@link xdc.bld.ITarget#sectMap} and the platform defines a
     *  memory region for each of these section types
     *  ({@link xdc.platform.IPlatform#codeMemory}/
     *  {@link xdc.platform.IPlatform#dataMemory}).  If
     *  this does not produce a result, an error is generated.
     *  It is important to note that `sectMap` does not contain the complete
     *  section allocation for the program. It only contains the entries
     *  explicitly added to `sectMap`. To get the complete section
     *  allocation, a user should call {@link #getSectMap}.

     *
     *  The `sectionsExclude` string is a JavaScript regular expression
     *  that is used to identify names of sections that should NOT be
     *  be handled by the normal linker command file generation process.
     *

     *  @p(code)
     *      // the sequence '^\.' matches just "." at the start of the name
     *      Program.sectionsExclude = "^\.";
     *  @p
     *  To override a specific sections you should be careful to supply a
     *  regular expression that matches the entire section name.  You can

     *  is useful especially when excluding specific sections via
     *  `{@link #sectionsExclude}` or when taking full control of the linker
     *  command file via `{@link #linkTemplate}` is unnecessary.  The original
     *  "`SECTIONS`" content is computed and passed as an argument to this
     *  template, which makes it relatively simple to perform small changes to
     *  the "`SECTIONS`" content without having to explicitly handle every
     *  section required by the compiler toolchain.
     *
     *  The `sectionsTemplate` string names a package path relative path; e.g.,
     *  if the linker template you want to specify is
     *  `"templates/mySections.xdt"` in the package `myCompany.myPackage`,
     *  `sectionsTemplate` should be set to:
     *  @p(code)
     *      "myCompany/myPackage/templates/mySections.xdt"
     *  @p

     *  to specify a file relative to the current working directory.
     *
     *  In any case, if `sectionsTemplate` is non-`null`, the file must exist;
     *  otherwise, the configuration step will fail.
     *
     *  During expansion of this template, there are three "parameters"
     *  that can be referenced to generate new content.
     *  @p(dlist)
     *      - `this`
     *          reference to the `{@link Program}` object
     *      - `$args[0]`
     *         is the complete section map derived from
     *         `{@link Program#sectMap}`; some special sections relevant to
     *         XDCtools are added to the map defined by `Program.sectMap`.
     *      - `$args[1]`
     *         is a string that contains the content that would have been
     *         placed in the `SECTIONS` portion of the generated linker
     *         command file.  This allows templates to easily modify this
     *         content or simply add statements before or after it.
     *  @p
     *  @a(Example)
     *  The following template, specific to TI compiler tools, adds start
     *  and size symbols for the `.stack` section and ensures that the stack
     *  is the first section to be allocated in its designated memory segment.
     *  @p(code)
     *    %// first output allocation for the .stack section
     *    %var sectMap = $args[0];

     *    %
     *    %// now append the normally generated content
     *    `$args[1]`
     *  @p
     *  Note: this example requires that the `.stack` section be excluded
     *  from the normal generation via `{@link sectionsExclude}`; otherwise

     *  `xdc/cfg/global.h`.

     *  @p(dlist)
     *      - `xdc_cfg__header__`
     *          the package qualified name of the executable-specific C/C++
     *          header generated by the program configuration tool; e.g.,
     *          `local/examples/package/cfg/mycfg_x62.h`.
     *  @p
     *  For example, to compile sources that reference the values declared in
     *  `{@link #global}` for a TI C6x target with a generated
     *  configuration header named `package/cfg/mycfg_x62.h` in a package
     *  named `local.examples` the following command line is sufficient:
     *  @p(code)
     *      cl6x -Dxdc_cfg__header__=local/examples/package/cfg/mycfg_x62.h ...
     *  @p
     *
     *  The `xdc_cfg__header__` symbol is automatically defined when you use
     *  the the XDC Build Engine (`{@link xdc.bld}`) to create executables; see
