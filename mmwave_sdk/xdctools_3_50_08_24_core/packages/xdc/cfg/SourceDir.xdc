 *  ======== SourceDir ========
 *  Manage config generated source directories
 *
 *  Every "product" can generate a collection of source files that
 *  must be compiled into a single library and linked with the
 *  application.  Each collection of source files is placed in a
 *  subdirectory of a top-level directory and contains a GNU make file,
 *  named makefile, which builds the library.
 *
 *  This module generates a top-level makefile that builds all "product"
 *  libraries, the top-level directory that houses the "product"
 *  sub-directories, and any files necessary for integration with eclipse/CDT
 *  managed make.  The generated "product" files need only ensure their
 *  sources can be built via their generated makefile (from their
 *  sub-directory).
