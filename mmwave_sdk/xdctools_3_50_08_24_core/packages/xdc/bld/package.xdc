 *  ======== xdc.bld ========
 *  The XDC Build Model
 *
 *  This package contains the XDC Build Model and the interfaces necessary
 *  to extend the Build Model to handle new compiler tool chains.  The
 *  modules in this package (and the instances managed by these modules)
 *  form the Build Object Model (BOM).
 *
 *  This model enables build scripts to declare the contents of each release
 *  of a package.  Based on these manifests, the Build Engine generates
 *  makefiles that build the specified object files, libraries, and
 *  executables, and archive these files into specified release files.  In
 *  addition, the generated makefiles are also capable of running collections
 *  of executables with command line arguments (provided that the platforms
 *  support this); e.g., regression tests.
 *
 *  @a(NOTE) User supplied file names of source files, generated libraries and
 *           executables must be limited to portable POSIX file names. That
 *           means that only alphanumeric charaters, and '_', '.', and '-'
 *           are allowed.
 *
 *  @a(throws)
 *  `XDCException` exceptions are thrown for fatal errors. The following error
 *  codes are reported in the exception message:
 *
 *   @p(dlist)                            
 *      -  `xdc.bld.TARGET_CONFIG_ERROR`
 *           This error is reported whenever there is an  error in
 *           the target configuration file. Check the configuration script
 *           for errors. 
 *      -  `xdc.bld.ROOTDIR_NOT_SET`
 *           This error is reported when the `rootDir` property for a target
 *           has not been set in the target configuration script. Ensure
 *           that this property is set correctly in the configuration
 *           script.   
 *      -  `xdc.bld.PLATFORM_NOT_SET`
 *           This error is reported when either 1) the `platform` property for
 *           a target has not been set in the target specification or the 
 *           target configuration script (config.bld) or 2) the build script
 *           (package.bld) is setting the platform for a program to an
 *           invalid value.
 *      -  `xdc.bld.DUPLICATE_TARGET_ERROR`
 *           This error is reported when a same target is listed twice in 
 *           `Bld.targets`. Check `{@link xdc.bld.BuildEnvironment#targets}`
 *	     to find out how `Bld.targets` is constructed.
