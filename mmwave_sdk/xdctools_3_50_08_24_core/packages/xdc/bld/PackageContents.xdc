/*!
 *  ======== PackageContents ========
 *  Package container populated by a build script.
 *
 *  This module defines the `PackageContents` object (aliased as `Pkg` in 
 *  build scripts) which represents the contents of a package.  Build scripts
 *  add to this package using the add* methods defined below.
 *
 *  In addition to the items added by the build script, every package has at
 *  least one release, the default release.  If the {@link #defaultRelease}
 *  configuration parameter is not set, a default release will be
 *  implicitly created.
 *
 *  Every library, executable, and repository added to the package is
 *  automatically added to the default release.

metaonly module PackageContents {
    /*!
     *  ======== Attrs ========
     *  Package-level attributes.
     *
     *  These attributes provide package-level defaults for attributes that
     *  provide control over the code generation tools, the configuration
     *  tool, and release options.
     *
     *  @field(profile)  This string names a profile defined by the
     *          executable's target.  A profile specifies a set of compiler,
     *          linker, and archiver options that are to be used when 
     *          compiling and linking code.  Note that these tool options are
     *          in addition to any options specified via `aopts`, `copts`,
     *		etc.
     *
     *          If this field is not specified or set to `null`, the
     *          `"release"` profile will be used.
     *
     *  @field(incs)  This string contains include path options used by
     *          the compiler (or assembler) to locate include files; e.g.,
     *          "`-I ../../include -I ../c55xx`".  Note that the syntax of 
     *          this string may be target dependent.
     *
     *  @field(defs)  This string contains options used by the
     *          compiler (or assembler) to define macros; e.g.,
     *          "`-D_C6xxx -DDEBUG=1`".  Note that the syntax of 
     *          this string may be target dependent.
     *
     *  @field(aopts)  This string contains options used by the assembler
     *          to produce object files; e.g., "`-mP1`".  Note that the syntax
     *          of this string may be target dependent.
     *
     *  @field(copts)  This string contains options used by the C/C++
     *          compiler to produce object files; e.g., "`-o3 -mi1`".  Note
     *          that the syntax of this string may be target dependent.
     *
     *  @field(cfgcopts)  This string contains options used by the C/C++
     *          compiler to compile the generated C config file. If `cfgopts`
     *          is not specified, the options specified in `copts` are
     *          used instead. 
     *
     *  @field(lopts)  This string contains options used by the linker
     *          produce object files; e.g., "`-l mylib.lib`".  Note
     *          that the syntax of this string may be target dependent.
     *
     *  @field(xsopts)  This string contains options passed to the
     *          `{@link http://rtsc.eclipse.org/docs-tip/Command_-_xs xs}`
     *          command that's used to run configuration scripts.  This option
     *          can be used, for example, to define name-value pairs accessible
     *          to configuration scripts via the XDCscript global
     *          `environment` hash-table.  For example, setting `xsopts` to
     *          `"-DFOO=bar"` enables the configuration script to get the
     *          value of `FOO` via the expression `environment["FOO"]`.  For
     *          more information about XDCscript and `environment` see
     *          {@link http://rtsc.eclipse.org/docs-tip/The_XDCscript_Language The XDCscript Language}.
     *
     *  @field(exportCfg)  If this field is set to `true`,  configuration
     *          scripts will, by default, be part of the releases created
     *          by this package.  
     *
     *  @field(exportDoc)  If this field is set to `true`,  generated
     *          documentation will, by default, be part of the releases 
     *          created by this package.  
     *
     *  @field(exportSrc)  If this field is set to `true`, the sources
     *          used to build this package will, by default, be part of the
     *          releases created by this package.
     *
     *  @field(exportExe)  If this field is set to `true`, the executables
     *          created in this package will, by default, be part of the
     *          releases created by this package.
     *
     *  @field(exportAll)  If this field is set to true, all files
     *          in this package that are not known to be generated are in
     *		the release.  If it is unspecified (or set to `null`) these
     *		files will not be added to this release. See
     *          `{@link xdc.bld.Release#Attrs}` for more information about
     *          this option.
     *
     *  @field(relScript)  If this field is non-`null`, the string names a
     *          "release script" that is run to post-process the
     *          files that are part of a release.  Like configuration scripts,
     *          the string names a script file that is searched for first in
     *          the in package's base directory, and then along the package
     *          path.
     *
     *  @field(relScriptArgs)  If this field is non-`null`, the string is
     *          used to initialize the `arguments[]` array which is
     *          accessible to the release script named by `relScript`.  The
     *          elements of the `arguments[]` array are formed from the white
     *          space separated elements of `relScriptArgs`.  If this string
     *          is `null` or empty, the `arguments[]` array has length `0`.
     *
     *  @field(compress) If this field is set to `true`, the package release
     *          archive files will be, by default, compressed; otherwise, the
     *          archives will not be compressed
     *
     *  @field(archiver) This field names the archiver to use when creating a
     *          release.  Two archivers are currently supported:
     *          "tar" and "zip".  If the archiver is set to "zip"
     *          the `{@link #Attrs.compress}` field is implicitly set to
     *          `true`.

     *  is prepended to the name of the release name to form the name of the
     *  release archive.
     *
     *  For example, setting `releasePrefix` to `"../"` implies that a 
     *  release named `"exports/foo"` generates an archive file named
     *  `foo.tar` in the directory `"../exports"`.
     *
     * `releasePrefix` must either begin with the '^' character or be a

     *  i.e., the directory containing the package's specification file
     *  `package.xdc`.
     *
     *  If `releasePrefix` begins with the '^' character, the remainder of
     *  the string is treated as though it is relative to the package's
     *  repository.  In effect, the '^' character is replaced with an
     *  appropriate number of '../' sequences to sufficient to navigate to
     *  the package's repository.
     *
     *  For example, suppose your packages are in a repository named `"src"`.
     *  Setting `releasePrefix` to `"^/../exports"` implies that a release
     *  named `"foo"` generates an archive file named `foo.tar` in the
     *  directory named `"exports"` which is a sibling of `"src"` - the
     *  package's repository.
     *
     *  This prefix can be overridden on a per release basis; see
     *  `{@link xdc.bld.Release#Attrs}`.

     *  ======== uses ========
     *  Array of directory suffixes used to locate files.
     *
     *  This array of directory suffixes is used to locate package files 
     *  that are referenced (e.g., via #include) without the package name.
     *
     *  This array names package directory suffixes (found along the
     *  package path) that:
     *  @p(nlist)
     *      -  contain headers included by this package's sources which
     *         are included *without* using the package name, or
     *      -  contain JavaScript "import" files which are included (via
     *         `utils.importFile()`) *without* using the package name.
     *  @p
     *  This mechanism is used to support legacy code that does not
     *  explicitly name the package in the #include statements, and *only*
     *  affects the compiler's -I options (not the package path) and the
     *  configuration tool's import path (`config.importPath`).
     *
     *  Strings in the Pkg.uses array must not be absolute paths.  Each string
     *  in the Pkg.uses array must point to an existing directory that can be
     *  located along the package path.  The generated makefiles create an
     *  absolute path by simply appending the string from `uses[]` to each
     *  directory name in the package path until an existing directory is
     *  found.  The resulting absolute path is then passed to the compiler in
     *  a -I option, for example.
     *
     *  The directories named in this array may include sub-directories of
     *  any package in the package path.
     *
     *  The strings in this array should use '/' to separate directories;
