/*!
 *  ======== Library ========
 *  Model of a searchable collection of object files
 *
 *  A library is a collection of one or more object files that is searched
 *  to resolve undefined references at link time.
 *
 *  Instances of this module represent a target independent collection of
 *  object files that implement a single set of APIs.  Thus, a library is
 *  really a container of target-specific archives which contain the object
 *  files necessary to implement a common API.  Although, a library may
 *  contain target dependent APIs, each library is expected to
 *  encapsulate the same basic functionality independent of the target.
 *
 *  Instances must be created via the
 *  `{@link xdc.bld.PackageContents#addLibrary()}` function; this
 *  ensures that each library created appears in the package's manifest and
 *  that it properly "inherits" appropriate default attributes from the
 *  containing package.
 *
 *  Library instances are initially create without *any* objects; this ensures
 *  that the developer complete control over what objects should be in each
 *  library. Thus, even modules declared in a package's specification,
 *  `package.xdc`, must be explicitly added to each library in the package
 *  (via `{@link #addObjects()}`).

     *  ======== Attrs ========
     *  Optional attributes for a Library instance.
     *
     *  Unspecified attributes are "inherited" from
     *  `{@link xdc.bld.PackageContents#Attrs}`; i.e., if one of fields in this
     *  structure is unspecified *and* this field's name matches a field name
     *  in `{@link xdc.bld.PackageContents#attrs}`, then this field's value
     *  defaults to the value in specified by
     *  `{@link xdc.bld.PackageContents#attrs}`.  This mechanism makes it
     *  possible to establish package-wide default values for any of the
     *  "inherited" attributes.
     *
     *  Suppose, for example, that you want all archives in this
     *  package to be build with the '`release`' profile, but one particular 
     *  archive must be built with '`debug`' (because it is a source example).
     *  The following build script fragment shows how this can be
     *  accomplished:
     *  @p(code)
     *      Pkg.attrs.profile = 'release';
     *      var lib = Pkg.addLibrary('example', ..., {profile: 'debug'});
     *  @p
     *  @field(incs)  This string contains include path options used by
     *          the compiler (or assembler) to locate include files; e.g.,
     *          "`-I ../../include -I ../c55xx`".  Note that the syntax of 
     *          this string may be target dependent.
     *
     *  @field(defs)  This string contains options used by the
     *          compiler (or assembler) to define macros; e.g.,
     *          "`-D_C6xxx -DDEBUG=1`".  Note that the syntax of 
     *          this string may be target dependent.
     *
     *  @field(aopts)  This string contains options used by the assembler
     *          to produce object files; e.g., "`-mP1`".  Note that the syntax
     *          of this string may be target dependent.
     *
     *  @field(copts)  This string contains options used by the C/C++
     *          compiler to produce object files; e.g., "`-o3 -mi1`".  Note
     *          that the syntax of this string may be target dependent.
     *
     *  @field(aropts)  This string contains options used by the archiver
     *          produce archive files; e.g., "`-q`".  Note
     *          that the syntax of this string may be target dependent.
     *
     *  @field(exportSrc)  If this field is set to true, the sources
     *          specified via `{@link #addObjects}()`
     *          will be part of the releases named in the releases
     *          array.  If it is unspecified (or set to `null`) and the
     *          release specifies that sources are to be exported,
     *          the sources will be part of the release.  In
     *          all other cases, the sources are not part of the
     *          release.
     *
     *  @field(suffix)  If this string is set to a non-`null` value, it 
     *          specifies the suffix (or extension) of the archive produced.
     *          This suffix is used in lieu of the default suffix
     *          ("`.a<targ_suffix>`", where `<targ_suffix>` is the suffix
     *          property of the target used to create the archive).  So,
     *          care must be taken when creating multiple libraries for
     *          different targets to ensure that the resulting archive names
     *          are unique.
     *
     *  @field(profile)  This string names a profile defined by the
     *          library's target.  The profile specifies a set of compiler,
     *          assembler, and archiver options that are to be used when 
     *          producing the archive.  Note that these tool options are
     *          in addition to any options specified via `aopts`, `copts`,
     *          etc.
     *
     *  @field(releases)  This array contains releases that will contain the
     *          library.  Thus, a single library can be part of any set of
     *          releases.  Each library is always added to the package's
     *          "default release" in addition to any releases specified in
     *          the releases array.

     *
     *  Examples
     *
     *      1. Locate a source file whose name starts with "fir" with
     *      an extension supported by the library's target, compile it
     *      and add to the library lib:
     *      @p(code)
     *          lib.addObjects(["fir"]);
     *      @p
     *      If fir.c exists compile and add to lib, if fir.asm exists
     *      assemble and add to lib, etc.  If no such file is located,
     *      an warning is emitted.
     *
     *      2. Compile `fir.c` and `iir.c` and add to the library `lib`:
     *      @p(code)
     *          lib.addObjects(["fir.c", "iir.c"]);
     *      @p
     *      3. Names may include sub-directory prefixes.  In this case, the
     *      source will be located in a sub-directory of the current
     *      package.  The following statement declares that the file
     *      "`foo/fir.c`" should be compiled and added to the library
     *      `lib`:
     *      @p(code)
     *          lib.addObjects(["foo/fir.c"]);
     *      @p
     *      As in the previous examples, the extension ".c" is optional. 
     *      In case an extension is not supplied, each extension
     *      understood by the target will be tried until a source file
     *      is located.
     *
     *      4. It is also possible to supply file specific compilation
     *      options.
     *      @p(code)
     *          lib.addObjects(["fir.c", "iir.c"], {defs: "-D_DEBUG"});
     *      @p
     *      In this case, both files `fir.c` and `iir.c` will be compiled
     *      with the "`-D_DEBUG`" flag.  Any setting of `attrs.defs` in the
     *      library or package is overridden by this definition.
     *
     *  @param(names)       array of base names of the sources of object files
     *                      to be created and archived into the library.
     *			    See NOTE in `{@link xdc.bld}` for filename rules.
     *
     *  @param(objAttrs)    optional `{@link Object#Attrs}` for the array of
     *                      objects added; all objects named by `names` will be
     *                      given the attributes `objAttrs`.
     *
     *  @a(returns)         `void`
     *
     *  @a(throws)          `Error` exceptions are thrown for fatal errors
     *
