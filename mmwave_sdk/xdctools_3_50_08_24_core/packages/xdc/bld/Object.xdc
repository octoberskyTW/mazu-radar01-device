 *  ======== Object ========
 *  Model of a compiled (or assembled) form of a source file.
 *
 *  Instances of this module represent object files.  Instances must be
 *  created via either the `{@link xdc.bld.Library#addObjects()}` or
 *  `{@link xdc.bld.Executable#addObjects()}` functions; this ensures that each
 *  object file created appears in the package's manifest and that it

metaonly module Object {
    /*!
     *  ======== Attrs ========
     *  Optional attributes for an Object instance
     *
     *  Unspecified attributes are "inherited" from
     *  `{@link xdc.bld.Executable#Attrs}`
     *  (`{@link xdc.bld.Library#Attrs}`) if this Object is added to an
     *  `{@link xdc.bld.Executable}` (`{@link xdc.bld.Library}`); i.e., if one
     *  of fields in this structure is unspecified *and* this field's name
     *  matches a field name in `{@link xdc.bld.Executable#attrs}`,
     *  then this field's value defaults to the value in specified by
     *  `{@link xdc.bld.Executable#attrs}`.  This mechanism makes it possible
     *  to establish executable-wide default value for any of the "inherited"
     *  attributes.
     *
     *  Suppose, for example, that you want all object files in this package
     *  to be build with the '`-o4`' optimization flag, but one particular file
     *  must be built with '`-o2`' (because the optimizer has a bug that it
     *  causes it to fail on this file).  The following build script fragment
     *  shows how this can be accomplished:
     *  @p(code)
     *      var exe = Pkg.addExecutable(..., {copts: '-o4'});
     *      exe.addObjects(['complex'], {copts: '-o2'});
     *      exe.addObjects(['foo', 'bar', ...]);
     *  @p
     *  Since many `Executable.attrs` are "inherited" from
     *  `{@link xdc.bld.PackageContents#attrs}`, it is also possible to
     *  establish package-wide default for these attributes.
     *
     *  @field(profile)  This string names a profile defined by the
     *          target used to produce the object file.  The profile
     *          specifies a set of compiler and assembler options that are
     *          to be used when producing the object.  Note that these tool
     *          options are in addition to any options specified via aopts,
     *          copts, etc.
     *
     *  @field(incs)  This string contains include path options used by
     *          the compiler (or assembler) to locate include files; e.g.,
     *          "`-I ../../include -I ../c55xx`".  Note that the syntax of 
     *          this string may be target dependent.
     *
     *  @field(defs)  This string contains options used by the
     *          compiler (or assembler) to define macros; e.g.,
     *          "`-D_C6xxx -DDEBUG=1`".  Note that the syntax of 
     *          this string may be target dependent.
     *
     *  @field(aopts)  This string contains options used by the assembler
     *          to produce object files; e.g., "`-mP1`".  Note that the syntax
     *          of this string may be target dependent.
     *
     *  @field(copts)  This string contains options used by the C/C++
     *          compiler to produce object files; e.g., "`-o3 -mi1`".  Note
     *          that the syntax of this string may be target dependent.
     *
     *  @field(preBuilt) If equal to `true`, this Boolean flag indicates
     *          that this object does not need to be built from sources; e.g.,
     *          it has been pre-built and delivered as a binary file without
     *          sources or some custom rule already built this object file.
     *          For pre-built objects, no rule will be created to remove the
     *          file as part of a package clean operation, the relative path
     *          to the file must be fully specified, and all other Object
     *          attributes are ignored.
