package xdc.bld;

/*!
 *  ======== BuildEnvironment ========
 *  Global build environment
 *
 *  This module defines a global object (aliased as '`Build`' in build scripts)
 *  which is configured by a build "startup" script and read by package build
 *  scripts.
 *
 *  This module's configuration parameters are initialized by
 *  a "startup" script that is run prior to running a package's build
 *  script (`package.bld`).  This script (often named "`config.bld`") is
 *  responsible for specifying the the `{@link xdc.bld.ITarget#rootDir}`
 *  configuration parameter of all targets that appear in the
 *  `{@link #targets}` array; the `rootDir` configuration parameter specifies
 *  the absolute path to the installation directory of the compiler used to
 *  build for the specified target.  Typically one startup script is used to
 *  establish an environment for multiple packages.
 *
 *  Note: it does not matter if you do not have tools for all the targets
 *  mentioned in the startup script; if you do not build for a target,
 *  its setting in the startup script is irrelevant.
 *
 *  The startup script may configure this module as a function of the
 *  following global variables that exist before this script runs:
 *  @p(dlist)
 *    - `environment`
 *          a hash table of environment strings
 *    - `arguments`
 *          an array of string arguments to the `config.bld` script
 *          initialized as follows:
 *              `arguments[0]` - the file name of the `config.bld` script;
 *              `arguments[1]` - the first argument specified in `XDCARGS`;
 *                  ...;
 *              `arguments[n]` - the nth argument in `XDCARGS`.
 *    - `Build`
 *          an alias for this module (`xdc.bld.BuildEnvironment`)
 *          The following parameters of this object are initialized
 *          before the startup script runs:
 *              `hostOS`     - `{@link #HostOS}` enumeration identifier;
 *              `hostOSName` - "Windows", "Linux", "MacOS" or "Solaris"
 *    - `Pkg`
 *          an alias for this module (`xdc.bld.PackageContents`)
 *          The following parameters of this object are initialized
 *          before the startup script runs:
 *              `{@link PackageContents#name}` - the name of the current
 *              package;
 *              `{@link PackageContents#modules}` - array of module names
 *              supplied by this package; and
 *              `{@link PackageContents#interfaces}` - array of interface
 *              names supplied by this package
 *  @p
 *  When you build a package, the `xdc` command looks for the startup file
 *  using the following algorithm: 
 *  @p(nlist)
 *      -   if `XDCBUILDCFG` is defined on the `xdc` command line, its value is
 *          used;
 *      -   if `config.bld` exists in the current directory, this file is used;
 *      -   if `XDCBUILDCFG` is defined as an environment variable, its value
 *          is used;
 *      -   if `config.bld` exists along the package path (i.e. in `$XDCPATH`
 *          followed by the current package's repository), the first such
 *          file is used;
 *      -   if `$XDCROOT/config.bld` exists this file is used;
 *      -   if `$XDCROOT/etc/config.bld` exists, this file is used; and
 *          finally
 *      -   if no "startup file" can be found above, a fatal error is
 *          reported and the `xdc` command terminates with a non-zero exit
 *          status.

     *  (i.e., names of modules that implement `{@link xdc.bld.ITarget}`) or

    /*!

    /*!
     *  ======== targets ========
     *  Array of all targets that are supported for the current build
     *
     *  This array may be explicitly initialized by the build model's
     *  initial configuration script (by default, "`config.bld`").  For
     *  example, the following fragment specifies that just the
     *  `ti.targets.C64` target should be used:
     *  @p(code)
     *      // get the ti.targets.C64 module
     *      var C64 = xdc.module('ti.targets.C64');

     *      Build.targets[Build.targets.length++] = C64;
     *  @p

     *  `XDCTARGETS` environment variable or the `{@link #useTargets}`
     *  and `{@link #excludeTargets}` strings.  The `{@link #targets}` array
     *  is implicitly initialized if and only if the length of this array is
     *  0 after the build model's configuration script completes.
     *
     *  All targets that are in this array *must* have their
     *  `{@link xdc.bld.ITarget#rootDir}` property set.
     *
     *  @see #excludeTargets
     *  @see #useTargets
     */
    config ITarget.Module targets[];

    /*!
     *  ======== nativeTarget ========
     *  A target that defines the "native" target
     *
     *  This parameter allows build scripts to refer to the "native"
     *  target without explicitly naming the target.
     *
     *  For example, a `package.bld` script may add a library via:
     *  @p(code)
     *      Pkg.addLibrary("lib", Build.nativeTarget);
     *  @p
     *  In addition, it is possible to use `"native"` in `XDCTARGETS` or
     *  `{@link #useTargets}` to specify that
     *  `{@link #nativeTarget}` be added to the `{@link #targets}` array.
     *  Thus, it is possible to use the following command on *any* host to
     *  build for that host:
     *  @p(code)
     *      xdc XDCTARGETS=native
     *  @p
     *
     *  If this parameter is not set by the build model's configuration
     *  script, it is initialized to an appropriate default native target:
     *  @p(blist)
     *      - `{@link microsoft.targets.Win32}` for Windows hosts;
     *      - `{@link gnu.targets.Sparc}` for Solaris hosts; and

    /*!
     *  ======== platformTable ========
     *  A map of platform instance names to the parameters used to
     *  create them
     *
     *  This map allows one to define platform instances that require
     *  non-default parameter settings.  It also provides a way to
     *  publish a set of platforms to be shared among multiple build
     *  scripts.
     *
     *  @a(EXAMPLES)
     *  The following fragment defines a platform instance named
     *  `"ti.platforms.sim6xxx:big"` that corresponds to a platform instance
     *  created by the `ti.platforms.sim6xxx.Platform` module with the
     *  parameters `{endian: "big"}`:
     *  @p(code)
     *    Build.platformTable["ti.platforms.sim6xxx:big"] = {endian: "big"};
     *  @p
     *
     *  The following fragment redefines the default platform instance for
     *  the platform package `ti.platforms.sim6xxx` by specifying alternative
     *  instance creation parameters.
     *  @p(code)
     *    Build.platformTable["ti.platforms.sim6xxx"] = {
     *        endian: "little", verbose: false, ftpath: "c:/ftsuite_1_5",
     *    };
     *  @p
     *  Some platforms are "software abastractions" that can emulate a large
     *  number different physical platforms.  In the example below, the
     *  `ti.platforms.sim6xxx` platform package is capable of simulating
     *  any TMS320C6xxx device.  This particular platform package uses the
     *  name of the instance to determine the specific device that it should
     *  emulate.  So, the fragment below specifies a platform instance named
     *  `"ti.platforms.sim6xxx:TMS320C6416"` that emulates the `TMS320C6416`
     *  device, in little endian mode.
     *  @p(code)
     *    Build.platformTable["ti.platforms.sim6xxx:TMS320C6416"] = {
     *        endian: "little"
     *    };
     *  @p
     *  Software platform packages, such as the `ti.platforms.generic`, can
     *  even go as far as emulating any device from any "catalog" of
     *  devices.  In this example, we use the `ti.platforms.generic`
     *  platform package to define an instance named
     *  `ti.platforms.generic:c6416` that corresponds to a platform
     *  containing the TMS320C6416 device specified in the `ti.catalog.c6000`
     *  package of devices.
     *  @p(code)
     *    Build.platformTable["ti.platforms.generic:c6416"] = {
     *        deviceName: "TMS320C6416",
     *        catalogName: "ti.catalog.c6000",
     *    };
     *  @p
     *  @see ti.catalog.c6000
     *  @see ti.platforms.generic
     *  @see ti.platforms.sim6xxx
