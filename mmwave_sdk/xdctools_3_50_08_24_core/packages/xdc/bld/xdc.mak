#  ======== xdc.mak ========
#  Top-level makefile for making individual XDC packages.  See xdc_top.mak
#  for top-level make file for multi-package builds.
#
#  This file includes three other make files: 
#	TOOLS 		- this file defines the location of the Java Runtime
#			  Environment (JRE), the Java CLASSPATH, and numerous 
#			  file utilities required by the XDC makefiles.  This
#			  file may be modified to adapt the build system to
#			  your environment.
#
#	xdc_rules.mak	- this file defines the rules for making XDC 
#			  packages and programs and should not be modified.
#
#	package.mak	- this file is generated from package.bld, the 
#			  package's "build script".
#
#  This file contains heuristics for finding the first two files (package.bld
#  must be in the current working directory) and defines several macros that
#  make the included makefiles simpler and host OS independent.  In
#  particular, this file defines the following:
#
#	HOSTOS		- equals "Windows", "Linux" or "MacOS"
#	PATHCHAR	- equals ';' for Windows systems and ':' otherwise
#			  systems.
#	_PATH		- the initial value of the PATH environment variable
#			  this allows one to redefine PATH (for specific
#			  goals) in terms of the path defined by the user
#	CP		- copy file (preserve time and permissions)
#	ECHO		- output a message to stdout
#	GZIP		- GNU zip command
#	MSG		- output a message to stdout prefixed with '#' if
#			  commands are also being output; otherwise act as
#			  echo
#	MKDIR		- create directory
#	MV		- move (rename) file command
#	PWD		- echo current working directory
#	RM		- forcefully remove file command
#	RMDIR		- remove directory and its contents
#	TOUCH		- update file timestamp
#	TAR		- UNIX tar command
#	TEE		- UNIX tee command
#
#  In addition, there are a few custom commands created to facilitate
#  the creation of portable makefiles.
#
#	CMP		- similar to cmp but doesn't suport -l option and,
#			  in the future, may support XDC specific options
#
#	CMV		- similar to mv but doesn't update timestamp of
#			  destination if file contents are identical.
#
#	SAVENV		- dumps xdc environment variables that can affect
#			  the generated makefile; this tool is purely an
#			  optimization to reduce the overhead of checking
#			  to see if package.mak needs to be remade from
#			  within make.
#
#	SETDATE		- "touch-like" utility used to update file timestamps
#			  to suit the needs of make
#
#	PKGTOP		- return the package's top; ../^n where n is the
#			  number of components in it's name
#
#	FIXDEP		- post-process generated dependency files to add
#			  empty rules for dependencies that are outside
#			  the current package.
#
#	FIXLIST		- post-process generated zip/tar include files
#
#	XDCCPP		- copy a package
#
#	XDCRMP		- remove a package (but not any nested packages)
#
#	MKDEP		- generate dependencies from input source file.
#			  this should only be used in the event that the
#			  compiler does not support this capability
#			  directly; MKDEP may generate dependencies that
#			  are unnecessary (due to #ifdefs in the code)
#
#	XDC		- the xdc command itself; so custom makefiles
#			  can recursively call xdc portably.

#
#  Disable parallel builds in case the generated rules are broken
#
#.NOTPARALLEL:

#
#  Automatically remove targets whose commands fail
#
.DELETE_ON_ERROR:

#
#  remove the environment variable ENV from all commands to prevent shell from
#  sourcing the named file.  This file can only contain user specific settings
#  that should *not* affect the build.
#
unexport ENV

#
#  Include .xdcenv.mak, if it exists; otherwise xdc_rules.mak defines
#  rules for making this file.  This file is used to trigger re-builds if
#  certain environment variables change (e.g., XDCPATH).  It can also be used
#  to override/ignore these environment variables. If the environment variables
#  are overriden, we want to restrict it only to the current XDC instance.
#  Therefore, the variable _USEXDCENV_, which controls overwriting of variables,
#  is not exported to any other XDC instance that could be invoked from within
#  this XDC instance
