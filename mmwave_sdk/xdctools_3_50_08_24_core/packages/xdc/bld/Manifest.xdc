 *  ======== Manifest ========
 *  The manifest object for the release file post-processing model
 *
 *  Each package release corresponds to an archive of a subset of the
 *  development package's contents.  The contents of each release are
 *  specified by an instance of the `{@link Release}` module.  Each instance
 *  of the `Release` module can optionally specify a "release script" that
 *  can modify each file prior to it being added to the archive.  This script
 *  runs in the context of the "release file post-processing" model.
 *
 *  This module is the root of the "release file post-processing" model.
 *  Each file in a release may be optionally post-processed by a filter
 *  specified in `{@link #filterMap}.`  Other fields of this module provide
 *  a release-specific "context" for the operation of the filters.  For
 *  example, a filter may use `{@link #packageName}`, `{@link #releaseName}`,
 *  and `{@link #buildCount}` to prefix all C sources with comments that
 *  identify where they originated.
 *
 *  All the fields of this module (except `{@link #filterMap}`) are initialized
 *  before a "release script" is run.  After the release script completes,
 *  the release archive is created according to the filters specifed in
 *  `{@link #filterMap}`.  Files that have no filter are copied without
 *  modification into the release.

    /*!
     *  ======== Filter ========
     *  A file filter descriptor
     *
     *  @field(operation)  a JavaScript function that filters the specified
     *	    input file and puts the results in specified output file; it is
     *	    the output file that is archived as part of the release (not the
     *	    input file).
     *
     *	    The operation is called as follows:
     *      @p(code)
     *		operation(filter, src, dst, base)
     *      @p
     *	    where:
     *	    @p(dlist)
     *	      -`filter`
     *		    the filter object associated with the file being
     *		    processed (which specified `operation` as the function
     *		    to call)
     *	      -`src`
     *		    input file name (relative to the current working
     *		    directory)
     *	      -`dst`
     *		    output file name (relative to the current working
     *		    directory)
     *	      -`base`
     *		    string name of the file as it appears in the array
     *		    `Manifest.files`; unlike `dst`, it does not contain a
     *		    temporary directory name prefix.
     *
     *  @field(args)  array of arbitrary arguments passed to `operation`
     *	    (as a field of the filter object passed as the first argument to
     *	    `operation`)
     *
     *  @field(newFileName) the new name of the output file relative to the
     *	    top of the archive.  Normally this name should include the
     *	    package's name but, in situations where a release must support a
     *	    non-RTSC conformant physical design, `newFileName` can be anything.
     *
     *  @field(newFileMode) the access permissions of the output file.
     *	    Normally the file will have the access permissions that exist at
     *	    the time archive is created.  However, there may be times when
     *	    the developer wants/needs to make a file readonly that is (for
     *	    development purposes) writable.  Only two modes are supported "r"
     *	    (readonly) and "rw" (readable and writable).
     *

     *  ======== files ========
     *  An array of files in the release

     *  The file names in this array include the package's name; i.e.,
     *  these names are relative to the package's repository rather than 
     *  the package's build directory.
     *
     *  This value is initialized before the release script or any of its
     *  filters are run, and it contains the the names of the files specified
     *  directly or indirectly by the package's build script.
     *
     *  By default, this list does not contain all files in this package
     *  release, it excludes files that are commonly copied verbatim into
     *  the release (see below).  To get the complete list you must call
     *  `{@link #getAllFiles Manifest.getAllFiles}`.
     *
     *  The excluded files are those that are indirectly included either via
     *  @p(blist)
     *      - a directory named in `{@link PackageContents#otherFiles}` or
     *        `{@link Release#otherFiles}`,
     *      - a repository added via `{@link PackageContents#addRepository}`,
     *        or
     *      - the documentation directory named by
     *        `{@link PackageContents#docDir}`
     *  @p
     *
     *  It is possible to remove files from a release by removing it from
     *  this array; only files in this array or that are in the specified
     *  verbatim directories, the directories named above, will appear in
     *  the release.  To remove files that are in any of these directories
     *  use `{@link #getAllFiles Manifest.getAllFiles}` to re-initialize
     *  `files` so that it contains all of the release's files, then
     *  selectivly remove the files from this array.
     *
     *  It is also possible to add files to a release by adding files to
     *  this array.  In fact, files added to the release can be generated
     *  by the filter operation specified for the file in
     *  `{@link #filterMap}`.  However, since these files are only present
     *  in releases of a  package (they are not built as part of the normal
     *  build of `all` files and only appear in installed releases of a
     *  package), packages that must be built as part of building this
     *  release should not refer to these files.

     *  filter that is applied to the file before it is archived in a
     *  release.

     *  function named `copyright`.
