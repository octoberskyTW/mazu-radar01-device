 *  ======== Release ========
 *  Model of an archive of all files that are part of a release.
 *
 *  Release instances define a container object that represents all files that
 *  are part of a release of a package.  A release may, for example, include
 *  just the files necessary to support a particular ISA even though the
 *  package as a whole can support multiple ISAs.
 *
 *  Each Release instance is realized as a tar file containing the files
 *  that are part of a release of a package.

    /*!
     *  ======== Attrs ========
     *  Optional Release attributes
     *
     *  Unspecified attributes are "inherited" from
     *  `{@link xdc.bld.PackageContents#Attrs}`; i.e., if one of fields in
     *  this structure is unspecified *and* this field's name matches a field
     *  name in `{@link xdc.bld.PackageContents#Attrs}`, then
     *  this field's value defaults to the value in specified by
     *  `{@link xdc.bld.PackageContents#attrs}`.  This mechanism makes it
     *  possible to establish package-wide default values for any of the
     *  "inherited" attributes.
     *
     *  However, elements added to a release can "override" these attributes.
     *  For example, when an executable is added to a release and the
     *  executable's attributes specify `'exportSrc = false'`, the release
     *  will not contain the executable's sources (even if the release's
     *  `{@link #attrs}.exportSrc` attribute is set to `true`).
     *
     *  @field(exportCfg)  If this field is set to `true`, configuration
     *          scripts will be part of the release.  If it is unspecified
     *          (or set to `null`), program configuration scripts will not
     *          be added to this release.
     *
     *  @field(exportDoc)  If this field is set to `true`,  generated
     *          documentation will be part of the release.
     *
     *  @field(exportSrc)  If this field is set to `true`, sources
     *          used to produce object files will be part of the release.
     *          If it is unspecified (or set to `null`), no sources will
     *          be part of this release.
     *
     *  @field(exportExe)  If this field is set to `true`, executables
     *          will be part of the release.  If it is unspecified (or set
     *          to `null`), executables will not be part of this release.
     *
     *  @field(exportAll)  If this field is set to `true`, all files
     *          in this package that are not known to be generated are in
     *          the release.  If it is unspecified (or set to `null`), these
     *          files will not be added to this release.
     *
     *          Note that the set of files specified by `exportAll` is
     *          determined at the time the package's makefile is generated.
     *          If one of these files is subsequently removed before the
     *          release is built, the build of the release will fail; a file
     *          required by the release no longer exists.  If the file is
     *          not really required for the release, you must trigger a
     *          rebuild for the generated makefiles; either touch
     *          `package.bld` or remove the generated makefile and re-build
     *          the release.
     *
     *  @field(relScript)  If this field is non-`null`, the string names a
     *          "release script" that is run to post-process the
     *          files that are part of a release.  Like
     *          configuration scripts, the string names a script
     *          file that is searched for first in the in package's
     *          base directory, and then along the package path.  See
     *          `{@link Manifest}` for more information about release scripts
     *          and what they can do.
     *
     *  @field(relScriptArgs)  If this field is non-`null`, the string is
     *          used to initialize the `arguments[]` array which is
     *          accessible to the release script named by `relScript`.  The
     *          elements of the `arguments[]` array are formed from the white
     *          space separated elements of `relScriptArgs`.  If this string
     *          is `null` or empty, the `arguments[]` array has length `0`.
     *
     *  @field(label)  This string allows one to "tag" each release with a
     *          label that can be used by other tools to select appropriate
     *          releases.  For example, the label might contain customer names.
     *
     *          This label is not interpreted by the XDC tools.  It is simply 
     *          recorded in the package's build model XML file
     *          (`package/package.bld.xml`) and retrieved via
     *          `{@link xdc.bld.BuildEnvironment#getReleaseDescs()}`
     *
     *  @field(prefix)  This string allows one to "export" each release to a
     *          location outside of the package.  `prefix` is prepended
     *          to the name of the release name to form the name of the
     *          release archive.
     *
     *          For example, setting `prefix` to `"../"` implies that a 
     *          release named `"exports/foo"` generates an archive file named
     *          `foo.tar` in the directory `"../exports"`.
     *
     *          `prefix` must either begin with the '^' character or
     *          be a path that is relative to the package's "base"
     *          directory; i.e., the directory containing the package's
     *          specification file `package.xdc`.
     *
     *          If `prefix` begins with the '^' character, the
     *          remainder of the string is treated as though it is relative
     *          to the package's repository.  In effect, the '^' character is
     *          replaced with an appropriate number of '../' sequences to
     *          sufficient to navigate to the package's repository.
     *
     *          If it is not specified (or set to `null`) the current setting
     *          of `{@link xdc.bld.PackageContents#releasePrefix}` is used.
     *
     *  @field(compress) If this field is set to `true`, the release
     *          archive file will be compressed; otherwise, the
     *          archive will not be compressed.  Archives are compressed
     *          via `gzip`; compressed archives are `.tar.gz` files.
     *
     *  @field(archiver) This field names the archiver to use when creating a
     *          release.  Two archivers are currently supported:
     *          "tar" and "zip".  If the archiver is set to "zip"
     *          the `{@link #Attrs.compress}` field is implicitly set to
     *          `true`.
     *
     *  @see #attrs
