/* JavaScript arrays seems the most efficient choice for keeping Warning 
 * structures. Warning IDs will not be constrained to small number, and there is 
 * no requirement that there are no holes in the sequence of IDs. Also, it is 
 * important to minimize the search time so any type of the unordered list can't
 * be used. XDCscript arrays are not good because they are not sparse, XDCscript 
 * maps are not good because we can't force the maps to use string keys as
 * indices for the underlying Java Vector. For example, the following sequence:
 * Map.add("1", WARN1);
 * Map.add("3", WARN2);
 * causes the first entry to be added as Map[0], and the second entry as Map[1].
 * We would have to add entries in a very constrained way to keep the key and
 * the index the same.
 *
 * The IDs are at the same time indices in the array, but also members of the
 * element structure. This means some information is duplicated, but for now I
 * will leave it as that because I set the ID in the structure to -1 to mark
 * the entry disabled.

 * the element structure is -1, that warning should be skipped over. However, in

 * disable() is called after module$meta$init, and module$meta$init is the only
 * place where new Warnings are added.
