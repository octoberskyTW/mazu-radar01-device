/*!
 *  ======== StateReader ========
 *  These APIs are all designed so that they will not re-read data that has already been read in.
 *
 *  The StateReader has three similar APIs for reading instance state:
 *    fetchInstState 
 *    fetchHandleState
 *    getInstDesc
 *
 *  fetchInstState takes an instance address and its index into the array of
 *  static instances (or -1 if dynamic). This is called by fetchAllInstStates,
 *  knows the index because it's iterating over the list.
 *
 *  fetchHandleState just takes an instance address. It looks through the list
 *  of instances to determine the index, then calls down to fetchInstState.
 *  This API is called by Program.scanHandle.
 *
 *  getInstDesc takes a decoded instance state structure and the index. Both
 *  fetch functions ultimately call down to this API. It is also called
 *  directly by Program.scanObject for scanning embedded objects.
