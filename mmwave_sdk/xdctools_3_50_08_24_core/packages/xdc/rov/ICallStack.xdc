 *  ======== ICallStack ========
 *  A call stack interface (optionally) implementated by ROV servers
 *
 *  Instances of this interface maintain a "local" set of processor
 *  registers sufficient to enable call stack parsing - walking up the C
 *  callstack and determining all nested calls up to the current program
 *  counter (specified by the local registers).  This "local" set of
 *  registers is, of course, processor specific and must include both
 *  the program counter ("PC") and a frame pointer (processor-specific
 *  register name).

     *  (or core dump file or ...) and sets the local register set
     *  accordingly.  For example, if the frame pointer register is named
     *  "FP" the following sequence should produce a stack trace:

     *      callstack.fetch(["PC", "FP"]);
