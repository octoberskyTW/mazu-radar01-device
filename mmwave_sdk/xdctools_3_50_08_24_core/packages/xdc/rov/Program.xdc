     *  ======== FetchDesc ========
     *  Description of data to fetch
     *
     *  A FetchDesc object is required as the first argument of the
     *  `{@link #fetchStruct}` and `{@link #fetchArray}` methods.
     *  The FetchDesc tells ROV the type of the data to be
     *  fetched so it knows how much data to read and how to decode it.
     *
     *  Every reference-type field in a state structure has a FetchDesc
     *  generated for it, with the name `<field name>$fetchDesc`.
     *
     *  For example, the instance structure
     *  @p(code)
     *      struct Instance_State {
     *          Char stack[];
     *      ];
     *  @p
     *  will have defined `obj.stack$fetchDesc`, which can be used to fetch
     *  the array:
     *  @p(code)
     *      var data = Program.fetchArray(obj.stack$fetchDesc, obj.stack, len);
     *  @p
     *
     *  @field(type)     the fully qualified name of a specified type; i.e.,
     *                   a type declared in some .xdc file.  For example,
     *                   "xdc.runtime.Types.Timestamp64".
     *  @field(isScalar) if fetching an array, are the elements of the array
     *                   really just one of the "scalar structs" defined by
     *                   xdc.rov.support.ScalarStructs.
