 *  ======== Memory ========
 *  Static and run-time memory manager
 *

 *  `{@link #staticPlace Memory.staticPlace()}` at build time or through
 *  `{@link #alloc Memory_alloc()}` (or its varients `Memory_calloc()`,
 *  `Memory_valloc()`, etc.) at run-time.
 *
 *  Run-time memory management is performed by modules that
 *  implement the `{@link xdc.runtime.IHeap}` interface.  The `Memory` module
 *  itself simply provides a common interface for any variety of system and
 *  application specific memory management policies implemented by `IHeap`
 *  modules; for example, `{@link HeadStd}` and `{@link HeadMin}`.
 *
 *  Heap instances are created statically or dynamically via heap specific
 *  create functions and these instances are then passed as an input
 *  parameter to the `Memory` calls that have a
 *  `{@link xdc.runtime.IHeap#Handle}` parameter.

     *  ======== staticPlace ========

     *  This function places the object specified by `obj` into the specified
     *  memory section. The section string is a target-specific name that is
     *  interpreted by the underlying target tool-chain.  In the case of TI
     *  tool-chains, this section can be a subsection (e.g.
     *  ".data:someSection").
     *
     *  The amount of memory that is created for `obj` is dependent on its
     *  size and the value of the property `length`. The length (number
     *  of elements in an array) is set before the `staticPlace()` is called.
     *  For example, setting `obj.length = 5;` before calling `staticPlace()`,
     *  will create `5 * sizeof (obj)` MADUs of memory.
     *
     *  If 0 is specified for the alignment, the allocated buffer is aligned 
     *  as determined by the target toolchain. For instance, if `obj` is an
     *  array of structs that have only 16-bit integers, the alignment would
     *  be on a 16-bit boundary. 
     *
     *  All non-zero alignments must be a power of 2. Not all targets support
     *  directives that allow one to specify alignment. The readonly config
     *  parameter
     *  `{@link xdc.cfg.Program#build Program.build.target.alignDirectiveSupported}`
     *  can be used to determine if the target supports alignment directives.

     *
     *  @param(align)   the alignment required by `obj`
     *
     *  @param(section) section name to contain `obj`

     *

     *  Returns `false` if the alignment request cannot be honored. The `obj`
