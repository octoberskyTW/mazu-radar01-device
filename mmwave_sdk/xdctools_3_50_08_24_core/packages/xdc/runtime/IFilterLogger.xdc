 *  ======== IFilterLogger ========
 *  Interface for supporting filtering of Log events by detail level.
 *
 *  Filtering of events based on detail level is not inherently supported
 *  by the Log APIs as is filtering of events based on the diagnostics mask.
 *  
 *  Support for this type of filtering must be done by an `ILogger` 
 *  implementation. Not all users are interested in this filtering support,
 *  however, so it is not required of all `ILogger` implementations.
 *
 *  `ILoggers` that do intend to support filtering by detail level should 
 *  implement this interface, which extends the `ILogger` interface.
 *
 *  The `{@link #setFilterLevel}` and `{@link #getFilterLevel}` functions
 *  support runtime specification of a different filtering level for each of
 *  the diagnostics categories.
