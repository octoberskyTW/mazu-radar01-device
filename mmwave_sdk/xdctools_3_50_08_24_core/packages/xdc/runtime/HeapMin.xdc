 *  ======== HeapMin ========
 *  Growth-only based heap implementation.
 *
 *  `HeapMin` is a minimal footprint heap implementation. This module is 
 *  is designed for applications that only create module instances and
 *  generally only allocate memory at runtime, but never delete created
 *  instances or free memory explicitly.
 *  
 *  For configuration-time `HeapMin.create`, the heap is aligned to 
 *  `{@link Memory#getMaxDefaultTypeAlignMeta()}` for those targets that support
 *  static alignment. For targets that do not support static alignment, the
 *  buffer alignment is undefined.
 *
 *  When calling `{@link #create()}` at runtime, the client 
 *  is responsible for aligning the buffer.
