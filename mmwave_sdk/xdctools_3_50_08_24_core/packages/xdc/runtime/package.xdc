 *  ======== xdc.runtime ========
 *  Basic runtime support for RTSC programs
 *
 *  The modules and interfaces in the `xdc.runtime` package form the "core"
 *  RTSC target runtime support library which provides basic system services
 *  required by virtually all applications.
 *
 *  Since this package's services are intended to be available to any
 *  C/C++ client, this package does not contain any pre-compiled libraries.
 *  Instead, this package provides complete sources which are built and
 *  supplied by a target-specific package named by the
 *  `{@link xdc.bld.ITarget#rts rts}` parameter of the target used to build
 *  the client sources.  This "indirection" make it possible for new targets
 *  to be added by interested parties whithout ever having to update this
 *  package.
 *
 *  The functionality provided by this package can be roughly partitioned
 *  into four categories:
 *  @p(nlist)
 *      - Diagnostics and Logs
 *      - Memory Management
 *      - Concurrency Support
 *      - Startup and Shutdown
 *  @p
 *  @a(Diagnostics and Logs)
 *  This package provides for diagnostics with a set of modules that operate
 *  together to configure and implement diagnostics.
 *
 *  The modules can be partitioned into three groups: modules that
 *  generate events, a module that allows precise control over when
 *  (or if) various events are generated, and modules that manage the
 *  output or display of the events.
 *
 *  `{@link Assert}`, `{@link Error}`, and `{@link Log}` provide methods that
 *  are added to source code and generate events. The `{@link Diags}` module
 *  provides both configuration and runtime methods to selectively enable or
 *  disable different types of events on a per module basis. Finally,
 *  `{@link LoggerBuf}`, `{@link LoggerSys}` and `{@link LoggerCallback}` are 
 *  simple alternative implementations of the `{@link ILogger}` event "handler"
 *  interface. You can provide more sophisticated or platform-specific
 *  implementations of `ILogger` without making any changes to code that
 *  uses `Assert`, `Log`, `Error`, or `Diags`.
 *
 *  The diagnostics and logger modules include the following:
 *  @p(blist)
 *  - `{@link Assert}`         - Add integrity checks to the code.
 *  - `{@link Diags}`          - Manage a module's diagnostics mask.
 *  - `{@link Error}`          - Raise error events.
 *  - `{@link Log}`            - Generate log events in realtime.
 *  - `{@link LoggerBuf}`      - A logger using a buffer for log events.
 *  - `{@link LoggerCallback}` - A logger using user defined callback function
 *                               for log events.
 *  - `{@link LoggerSys}`      - A logger using printf for log events.
 *  - `{@link Types}`          - Define diagnostics configuration parameters.
 *  - `{@link Timestamp}`      - Simple timestamp service
 *  @p
 *
 *  @a(Memory Management)
 *  The memory management modules include the following:
 *  @p(blist)
 *  - `{@link Memory}`  - module used by clients to allocate and free memory
 *  - `{@link HeapMin}` - Deterministic implementation that minimizes code
 *                        size footprint by not supporting reuse of allocated
 *                        memory.
 *  - `{@link HeapStd}` - Implementation that builds atop ANSI C `malloc()`
 *                        and `free()`
 *  @p
 *
 *  @a(Concurrency Support)
 *  The concurency support modules include the following:
 *  @p(blist)
 *  - `{@link Gate}`     -  module used by clients to serialize access to
 *                          shared data structures
 *  - `{@link GateNull}` - "null" implementation for applications that
 *                         don't need serialization; e.g., single threaded
 *                         applications
 *  @p
 *
 *  @a(Startup and Shutdown)
 *  The system startup and shutdown support modules include:
 *  @p(blist)
 *  - `{@link Reset}`       - Manages platform-specific startup initialization
 *                            before `main()` is called
 *  - `{@link Startup}`     - Manages "portable" startup initialization before
 *                            `main()` is called
 *  - `{@link System}`      - In addition to other basic services (such as
 *                            `printf`), this module provides an `atexit`
 *                            capability that allows modules to cleanly exit
 *                            during normal application terminiation.
 *  - `{@link SysCallback}` - Implementation of `{@link ISystemSupport}`
 *                            that calls back user defined functions.
 *  - `{@link SysMin}`      - Minimal implementation of `{@link ISystemSupport}`
 *                            required by the `System` module, suitable for
 *                            deeply embedded applications.
 *  - `{@link SysStd}`      - Implementation of `{@link ISystemSupport}`
 *                            that relies on ANSI C Standard I/O Library
 *                            functions.
