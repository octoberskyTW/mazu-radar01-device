package xdc.runtime;

/*!
 *  ======== Startup ========
 *  The `xdc.runtime` startup bootstrap
 *
 *  This module manages the very early startup initialization that occurs
 *  before C's `main()` function is invoked.  This initialization typically
 *  consists of setting hardware specific registers that control watchdog
 *  timers, access to memory, cache settings, clock speeds, etc.
 *
 *  In addition to configuration parameters that allow the user to add custom
 *  startup functions, this module also provides services that allow modules
 *  to automatically add initialiazation functions to the startup sequence.
 *
 *  @a(Startup Sequence)
 *  The following list defines the startup sequence and, in particular, when
 *  user provided startup functions are invoked:
 *  @p(nlist)
 *   - CPU is initialized and initial C stack setup is performed.
 *   - The function specified by `Startup.resetFxn` is called.
 *     `Startup.resetFxn` is called only on platforms where reset is performed
 *     before running a program. For example, boot code for all TI targets
 *     invokes `Startup.resetFxn`, but this function is not invoked on
 *     Microsoft targets.
 *   - C runtime initialization is performed.
 *   - Functions from the array `Startup.firstFxns` are called.
 *   - All `Mod_Module_startup` functions (see Module Initialization below) 
 *     are called in a loop until all such functions return
 *     `{@link #Startup_DONE}` or the `{@link #maxPasses}` threshold is
 *     reached.
 *   - Functions from the array `Startup.lastFxns` are called.
 *   - The function `main` is called.
 *  @p
 *     The steps 4 - 6 occur during C++ static object initialization. Since
 *     the ANSI C++ Language Standard does not provide a means to control
 *     the order of C++ constructors, if a C++ constructor uses an XDC module,
 *     there is no guarantee that the module's startup function already ran.
 *     Therefore, any C++ constructor that needs XDC modules' services should
 *     call `Startup_exec` first to force all startup related functions from
 *     steps 4 - 6 to run, before the constructor uses any XDC module.
 *  @p
 *     Also, if a target does not support C++, the steps 4 - 6 will not run
 *     automatically. It is then up to a user's code to invoke `Startup_exec`,
 *     possibly as the first step in `main`.
 *  @p
 *
 *  @a(Module Initialization)
 *  Every module can optionally define a startup function which is called
 *  before `main()`.  Modules declare that they want to participate in this
 *  startup sequence via the `@ModuleStartup` attribute in the module's spec
 *  file.  Modules that use this attribute must also implement the following
 *  startup function:
 *  @p(code)
 *      Int Mod_Module_startup(Int state);
 *  @p
 *  where "Mod" is the name of the module requesting startup support.
 *
 *  The parameter to the startup function serves as "state variable" whose
 *  initial value will be `Startup_NOTDONE`. If `startup()` returns a value
 *  other than `Startup_DONE`, it will be called in a subsequent pass with this
 *  return value passed in as `state`.  To ensure this process terminates,
 *  no startup function is ever called more than `{@link #maxPasses}`
 *  times.
 *
 *  For situations in which the startup of one module depends upon another
 *  having completed its startup processing, the following function is
 *  automatically defined for all modules and proxies:
 *  @p(code)
 *      Bool Mod_Module_startupDone();
 *  @p
 *  where "Mod" is the name of some module or proxy.  These predicates can
 *  be used as guards inside of a startup function to probe whether a
 *  particular module has completed its own startup processing.  As a
 *  convenience, the function `Startup_rtsDone()` probes the necessary set of
 *  `xdc.runtime` modules required to support instance `create()` functions, and
 *  should be called before any startup-time instance creation and/or
 *  memory allocation is performed.
 *  @p(code)
 *      Int Mod_Module_startup(Int state)
 *      {
 *          if (!Startup_rtsDone()) {
 *              return (Startup_NOTDONE);
 *          }
 *              .
 *              .
 *              .
 *          return (Startup_DONE);
 *      }
 *  @p
 *
 *  @a(Examples)
 *  The following code shows how to add custom startup functions to this module.
 *  @p(code)
 *      var Startup = xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.Startup');
 *      Startup.resetFxn = "&myResetFxn";
 *      Startup.firstFxns[Startup.firstFxns.length++] = "&myFirst";
 *      Startup.lastFxns[Startup.lastFxns.length++] = "&myLast";
 *  @p
 *
