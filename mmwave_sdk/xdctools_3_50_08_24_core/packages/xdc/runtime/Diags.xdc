 *  ======== Diags ========
 *  Diagnostics manager
 *
 *  Every XDC module has a "diagnostics mask" that allows clients to
 *  enable or disable diagnostics on a per module basis both at
 *  configuration time and at runtime. The `Diags` module manages a
 *  module's diagnostics mask.
 *
 *  You use the `Diags` module to set and clear bits in a module's
 *  diagnostics mask for the purpose of controlling diagnostics
 *  within that module. Each bit corresponds to a "category" of diagnostic
 *  that can be individually enabled or disabled.
 *
 *  A module's diagnostics mask controls both `{@link Assert}` and
 *  `{@link Log}` statements within that module. A module's diagnostics
 *  mask may also be used to conditionally execute blocks of code using
 *  the `{@link #query Diags_query()}` runtime function.
 *
 *  A module's diagnostics mask can be set at configuration time and
 *  at runtime. The implementation of diagnostics is such that when they
 *  are permanently turned off at configuration time
 *  (`{@link #ALWAYS_OFF Mode.ALWAYS_OFF}`), an optimizer can
 *  completely eliminate the diagnostics code from the program. Similarly,
 *  if diagnostics are permanently turned on at configuration time
 *  (`{@link #ALWAYS_ON Mode.ALWAYS_ON}`), the optimizer can
 *  eliminate all runtime conditional checking and simply
 *  invoke the diagnostics code directly. Runtime checking of the
 *  diagnostics mask is performed only when the diagnostics are configured
 *  to be runtime modifiable (`{@link #RUNTIME_OFF Mode.RUNTIME_OFF}` or
 *  `{@link #RUNTIME_ON Mode.RUNTIME_ON}`).
 *
 *  Each bit of the diagnostics mask is controlled by one of the following
 *  constants.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  Constant    Meaning
 *  --------------------------
 *  ENTRY       Function entry
 *  EXIT        Function exit
 *  LIFECYCLE   Object life-cycle
 *  INTERNAL    Internal diagnostics
 *  ASSERT      Assert checking
 *  STATUS      Warning or Error events
 *  USER1       User defined diagnostics
 *  USER2       User defined diagnostics
 *  USER3       User defined diagnostics
 *  USER4       User defined diagnostics
 *  USER5       User defined diagnostics
 *  USER6       User defined diagnostics
 *  USER7       User defined diagnostics
 *  INFO        Informational event
 *  USER8       User defined diagnostics
 *  ANALYSIS    Analysis event
 *  @p
 *
 *  These constants can be used from either JavaScript configuration
 *  scripts or C code and, therefore, have two "names". For example,
 *  to reference the ENTRY constant from JavaScript you must use
 *  `Diags.ENTRY` whereas from C you would use `Diags_ENTRY`.
 *
 *  The `ENTRY` and `EXIT` categories are for log statements at the entry and
 *  exit points, respectively, to each function within a module. This
 *  is useful for tracking the execution flow of your program.
 *
 *  The `LIFECYCLE` category is for log events at the create/construct
 *  and delete/destruct points of each instance object for the module.
 *  This is useful for tracking the life-cycle of a module instance object.
 *
 *  `ASSERT` and `INTERNAL` are unique in that they are not related to logging,
 *  but instead control the Assert statements in a module. These categories
 *  control the two classes of asserts:
 *
 *  @p(blist)
 *  - Public asserts, which have an `{@link Assert#Id Assert_Id}` and
 *  are documented in the module's reference pages. These asserts are
 *  on by default and are meant to help developers validate code that
 *  invokes a module's functions.
 *  - Internal asserts, which have no `{@link Assert#Id Assert_Id}`.
 *  These asserts are off by default and are typically used only when
 *  developing code. That is, like the standard C assert() mechanism,
 *  these asserts are not part of a deployed application.
 *  @p
 *
 *  When a module has enabled the `ASSERT` category (which is enabled by
 *  default) in its diagnostics mask, the module executes all of its public
 *  assert statements. To enable internal asserts, you must enable both the
 *  `ASSERT` and `INTERNAL` categories.
 *
 *  The `ASSERT` and `INTERNAL` categories are not intended for use as log
 *  event categories. If an event is defined with either of these categories,
 *  you will receive a validation error during configuration.
 *
 *  The `STATUS` category is used for error and warning type events. The
 *  four event levels within the `STATUS` category have defined meanings,
 *  see {@link #EMERGENCY}
 *
 *  The `INFO` category is used for generic informational events. Any event
 *  which does not belong to a more specific category of events may simply
 *  be an `INFO` event.
 *
 *  The `ANALYSIS` category is used for events related to benchmarks and
 *  performance analysis.
 *
 *  The `USER1`-`6` categories are available to each module writer to use as
 *  he or she wishes.
 *
 *  The USER7 and USER8 categories are still defined, but their bits have been
 *  repurposed for the INFO and ANALYSIS categories, respectively, so the use
 *  of USER7 and USER8 has been deprecated.
 *
 *  @a(Examples)
 *  Configuration example: The following XDC configuration statements set
 *  a module's diagnostics mask in a configuration script. (In this case,
 *  the `Task` module of the `ti.sysbios.knl` package is used.) In this
 *  example, the `ENTRY` bit is turned on and the `EXIT` bit is turned off.
 *  Both bits are configured to be runtime modifiable.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  var Diags = xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.Diags');
 *  var Task = xdc.useModule('ti.sysbios.knl.Task');
 *
 *  Task.common$.diags_ENTRY = Diags.RUNTIME_ON;
 *  Task.common$.diags_EXIT = Diags.RUNTIME_OFF;
 *  @p
 *
 *  @p(html)
 *  <hr />
 *  @p
 *
 *  Runtime example: The following C code shows how to disable and
 *  reenable `ENTER` diagnostics at runtime for the `ti.sysbios.knl.Task`
 *  module configured in the previous example. The first call to
 *  `{@link Diags#setMask Diag_setMask()}` enables entry diagnostics
 *  (`"+E"`) for just the `ti.sysbios.knl.Task` module; any call to any
 *  `Task` method in the application causes an "entry" `Log` event to be
 *  generated. The second call disables ("-E") the generation of these
 *  events. See `{@link #setMask Diags_setMask()}` for a complete
 *  description of the strings accepted by this function.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  #include <xdc/runtime/Diags.h>
 *  :
 *  Diags_setMask("ti.sysbios.knl.Task+E");
 *  :
 *  Diags_setMask("ti.sysbios.knl.Task-E");
 *  @p
 *
 *  @p(html)
 *  <hr />
 *  @p
 *
 *  Configuration example: The following XDC configuration statements
 *  turn on asserts in the entire program.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  var Diags = xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.Diags');
 *  var Defaults = xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.Defaults');
 *
 *  Defaults.diags_ASSERT = Diags.ALWAYS_ON;
 *  @p
 *
 *  @p(html)
 *  <hr />
 *  @p
 *
 *  Configuration example: Using the
 *  `{@link Diags#setMaskMeta Diags.setMaskMeta()}` function, the
 *  following XDC configuration statements turn on asserts in all
 *  of the modules whose name begins with "`ti.sysbios.`" In this case,
 *  no change to the application code is necessary to enable these
 *  events. It is important to note that, while the configuration
 *  step must be re-run and the application must be re-linked, no
 *  application sources need to be recompiled.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  var Diags = xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.Diags');
 *  Diags.setMaskMeta("ti.sysbios.%", Diags.ASSERT, Diags.ALWAYS_ON);
 *  @p

     *  At run-time a module's diagnostics mask is an ordinary data word

     *  This query function has a compile-time binding to the module's

     *  diagnostics mask. Otherwise, it will use the diagnostics mask
     *  of the `{@link Main xdc.runtime.Main}` module.
     *
     *  The implementation of the diagnostics mask and the query function
     *  is such that an optimizer can take advantage of dead code elimination
     *  and/or constant folding to eliminate or reduce code size. For example,
     *  if the query function is used in a conditional test, and the given

     *  off, then the code for the entire conditional statement can be removed

     *
     *  @param(mask) mask of diagnostics bits to test
     *
     *  This given mask is constructed by `OR`'ing together
     *  the desired bits of the diagnostics mask using the constants listed
     *  in the {@link #ALL Mask Summary} above. The module's diagnostics
     *  mask will be logically `AND`'ed with the given mask, and return `true`

     *
     *  This control string defines one or more actions

     *  to turn the module name into a prefix matching pattern for a set
     *  of modules. Multiple actions are separated with the `;` character.

     *  <module[%]><op><bits>[;<module[%]><op><bits>]
     *  @p
     *
     *  Specify individual module names explicitly (e.g. 
     *  `ti.sysbios.knl.Task`), or match multiple modules using a prefix

     *  @a(Examples)
     *  The following example demonstrates how to set a module's diagnostics
     *  mask (the `Task` module in this case) at runtime. In this example, the
     *  `{@link #USER1 USER1}` bit is turned on. Note that the module's
     *  `{@link #USER1 USER1}` diagnostics bit must be configured to be runtime
     *  modifiable. In this instance, the bit is initialized to off.
     *
     *  Configuration Script
     *  @p(code)
     *  var Diags = xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.Diags');
     *  var Task = xdc.useModule('ti.sysbios.knl.Task');
     *  Task.common$.diags_USER1 = Diags.RUNTIME_OFF;
     *  @p
     *
     *  C Code
     *  @p(code)
     *  Diags_setMask("ti.sysbios.knl.Task+1");
     *  @p
     *
     *  @p(html)
     *  <hr />
     *  @p
     *
     *  The following example demonstrates the use of the `%` wildcard
     *  character to set the `{@link #USER1 USER1}` bit at runtime for
     *  all modules in the `ti.sysbios.knl` package. The meta-only
     *  `{@link #setMaskMeta Diags.setMaskMeta}` function is used to configure
     *  the `{@link #USER1 USER1}` bit to be runtime modifiable. The `setMask`
     *  function is used to actually set the `{@link #USER1 USER1}` bit at
     *  runtime in all the `ti.sysbios.knl` modules.
     *  Note the use of the `%` character in both functions to match all the
     *  module names within the given package.
     *
     *  Configuration Script
     *  @p(code)
     *  var Diags = xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.Diags');
     *  Diags.setMaskMeta("ti.sysbios.knl.%", Diags.USER1, Diags.RUNTIME_OFF);
     *  @p
     *
     *  C Code
     *  @p(code)
     *  Diags_setMask("ti.sysbios.knl.%+1");
     *  @p
     *
     *  @p(html)
     *  <hr />
     *  @p
     *
     *  In the following example, the `{@link #ENTRY ENTRY}`, 
     *  `{@link #EXIT EXIT}` and `{@link #LIFECYCLE LIFECYCLE}` trace is
     *  enabled for all modules in the `ti.sysbios.knl` package but is
     *  initially off; i.e., no events will occur until explicitly turned
     *  on at runtime.
     *
     *  At runtime the call to `Diags_setMask` turns on
     *  `{@link #ENTRY ENTRY}` and `{@link #EXIT EXIT}` trace and turns off
     *  `{@link #LIFECYCLE LIFECYCLE}` trace for all modules in
     *  the application for which trace has been enabled during
     *  configuration.  In this case, the only modules that can generate
     *  events are those in the `ti.sysbios.knl` package.
     *
     *  Configuration Script
     *  @p(code)
     *  var Diags = xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.Diags');
     *  Diags.setMaskMeta("ti.sysbios.knl.%",
     *      Diags.ENTRY | Diags.EXIT | Diags.LIFECYCLE, Diags.RUNTIME_OFF);
     *  @p
