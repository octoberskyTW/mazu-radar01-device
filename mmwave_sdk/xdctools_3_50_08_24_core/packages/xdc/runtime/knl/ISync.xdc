/*!
 *  ======== ISync ========
 *  OS independent synchronization
 *
 *  This interface allows clients to select method of synchronization in an OS
 *  independent way.
 *
 *  Modules that require the user to pick a synchronization method, will
 *  request a `{@link #Handle}`. Clients of such modules can pick a blocking
 *  `ISync` implementation  or a non-blocking implementation.
 *
 *  This interface specifies two main functions `{@link #signal}` and
 *  `{@link #wait}`. These two functions are always used in pairs in modules 
 *  that use `ISync` instances. The `signal()` function is used to signal
 *  completion of an activity. The `wait()` function will allow the module to
 *  block or poll for completion of the same activity.
 *
 *  `ISync` mandates that the sync mechanism be binary and not support counters.
 *  Although the `wait()` function seems meaningless in the case of
 *  non-blocking sync, it allows modules to be written generically and support
 *  all `ISync` implementations. For non-blocking `ISync` the `wait()` function
 *  will return `WaitStatus_TIMEOUT` to denote timeout.
