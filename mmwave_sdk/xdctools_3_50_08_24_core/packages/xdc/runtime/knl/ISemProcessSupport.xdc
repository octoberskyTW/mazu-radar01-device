 *  Interface for OS specific back-end.
 *
 *  The {@link xdc.runtime.knl} package contains modules that provide typical
 *  OS services. These xdc.runtime.knl modules however require proxies to be
 *  bound to an OS specific delegate. This specifies the interface to 
 *  be implemented by the OS specific delegate for 
 *  {@link xdc.runtime.knl#SemProcess} module.
 *
 *  create() takes a 32-bit integer key parameter to be used for identifying
 *  the semaphore to create across processes. For example, for Linux System V
 *  semaphores, the key is necessary so that different processes can access
 *  the same semaphore.

    *  This function creates a new `SemProcess` object which is

    *  All semaphores created with the same key reference the same
    *  underlying synchronization object and work between processes.  The
    *  underlying synchronization object should be automatically deleted when
    *  all references to it have been deleted, and the reference count should
    *  be maintained consistently across process forks or similar operations.
    *  An implementation for a platform on which this is technically impossible
    *  (e.g. an operating system that does not support multiple processes) may
    *  provide a 'toy' implementation with behavior matching that of
    *  `{@link ISemProcessSupport}`.
