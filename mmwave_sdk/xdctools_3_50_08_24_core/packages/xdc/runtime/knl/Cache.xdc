 *  ======== Cache ========
 *  Cache Services
 *
 *  The Cache module provide APIs to allow applications to maintain cache
 *  coherency.
 *
 *  This module will use an OS specific delegate (back-end) to manipulate the
 *  cache.
 *  This module has a module wide config parameter {@link #Proxy} which needs to
 *  be bound to an OS specific delegate before this module can be used.
 *
 *  Here is an example showing how the proxy is bound to an BIOS 6.x specific
 *  delegate.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  var Cache = xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.knl.Cache');
 *  Cache.Proxy = xdc.useModule('ti.sysbios.xdcruntime.CacheSupport');
 *  @p
 *
 *  Typically the package containing the delegates have a Settings module that
 *  will bind all {@link xdc.runtime.knl} proxies. The following
 *  example sets up all the xdc.runtime.knl proxies.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  xdc.useModule("ti.sysbios.xdcruntime.Settings");
 *  @p
