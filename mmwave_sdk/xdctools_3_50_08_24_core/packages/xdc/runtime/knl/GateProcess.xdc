 *  ======== GateProcess ========
 *  Provides protection of critical sections across processes.
 *
 *  This module provides services through its proxy
 *  IGateProcessSupport interface. It has a module wide config parameter
 *  {@link #Proxy} which needs to be bound to an OS specific delegate before
 *  this module can be used.
 *
 *  Here is an example showing how the proxy is bound to an BIOS 6.x specific
 *  delegate.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  var GateProcess = xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.knl.GateProcess');
 *  GateProcess.Proxy =
 *      xdc.useModule('ti.sysbios.xdcruntime.GateProcessSupport');
 *  @p
 *
 *  Typically the package containing the delegates have a Settings module that 
 *  will bind all {@link xdc.runtime.knl} proxies. The following
 *  example sets up all the xdc.runtime.knl proxies.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  xdc.useModule("ti.sysbios.xdcruntime.Settings");
