/*!
 *  ======== Reset ========
 *  Startup reset function manager
 *
 *  This module defines an initial reset function and can be used without
 *  requiring any other `xdc.runtime` module.  The reset function is called
 *  as early as possible in the application startup and is intended for
 *  platform-specific hardware initialization.
 *
 *  The reset function sequentially calls each of the functions added to the
 *  `{@link #fxns}` array starting from index 0.  If
 *  `{@link Startup#resetFxn Startup.resetFxn}` is defined, it is called
 *  before any of the functions defined by the `fxns` array.
 *
 *  By providing an array of startup functions, rather than a single function
 *  as `{@link Startup}` does, modules that need very early initialization
 *  can simply add their initialization to the list of functions to be called
 *  without having to implement a "chaining" mechanism or requiring the user
 *  to implement and maintain an application reset function.
 *
 *  @a(Warning)
 *  The reset function is _not_ supported on all platforms and, as a result,
 *  you should never place any "portable" code that is required for your
 *  application in this function.  Use the `{@link Startup}` module to
 *  define required application startup functions.
 *

     *  This array defines the functions that will be executed by the reset
     *  initialization function (`xdc_runtime_Startup_reset__I`) _in addition
     *  to_ the function specified by `{@link Startup#resetFxn}`.
     *
     *  The following code fragment shows how to add the externally defined
     *  function `myReset()` to this array.

     *
     *  @a(Warning)
     *  Although the functions specified in `fxns[]` are ordinary C functions,
     *  they are often called _before_ the C runtime is fully initialized;
     *  e.g., they may be called _before_ static variables are initialized.
     *  Reset functions should only assume that a minimal execution stack has
     *  initialized.
