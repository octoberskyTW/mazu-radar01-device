 *  ======== System ========
 *  Basic system services
 *
 *  This module provides basic low-level "system" services; e.g.,
 *  character output, `printf`-like output, and exit handling.
 *
 *  This module is gated and other modules use its gate via the
 *  `{@link Gate#enterSystem}` and `{@link Gate#leaveSystem}`. The `System`
 *  gate must be enterable by any thread in a multi-threaded environments.  For
 *  example, in many real-time multi-threaded environments some types of
 *  threads, such as Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs), are not allowed to call
 *  operations that block the caller.  In such an environment, either the
 *  `System` gate must disable all interrupts or ISRs must never call a function
 *  in the `xdc.runtime` package.

     *  This function behaves much like the ANSI C Standard `printf`
     *  but does not support the full range of format strings specified by
     *  the C Standard.  In addition, several non-standard format specifiers
     *  are recognized.
     *
     *  @a(Format Strings)
     *  The format string is a character string composed of zero or
     *  more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied
     *  unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of
     *  which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.  Each
     *  conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends
     *  with a conversion specifier.  In between there may be (in this order)
     *  zero or more flags, an optional minimum field width, an optional
     *  precision and an optional length modifier.
     *
     *  @a(Flags)
     *  The following flags are supported:
     *  @p(dlist)
     *      - `-`
     *          The converted value is to be left adjusted on the field
     *          boundary (the default is right justification.)
     *      - `0`
     *          The value should be zero padded. For d, i, o, u, and x
     *          conversions, the converted value is padded on the left
     *          with zeros rather than blanks.
     *  @p
     *
     *  @a(Field Width)
     *  The optional field width specifier is a decimal digit string (with
     *  nonzero first digit) specifying a minimum field width. If the
     *  converted value has fewer characters than the field width, it will
     *  be padded with spaces on the left (or right, if the left-adjustment
     *  flag has been given).  Instead of a decimal digit string one may
     *  write `*` to specify that the field width is given in the next
     *  argument.  A negative field width is taken as a '-' flag followed
     *  by a positive field width.
     *
     *  @a(Precision)
     *  The optional precision specifier is a period ('.') followed by an
     *  optional decimal digit string.  Instead of a decimal digit string
     *  one may write `*` to specify that the precision is given in the 
     *  next argument which must be of type int.
     *
     *  If the precision is given as just '.', or the precision is
     *  negative, the precision is taken to be zero.  This gives the
     *  minimum number of digits to appear for d, i, o, u, and x
     *  conversions, or the maximum number of characters to be printed from
     *  a string for s conversions.
     *
     *  @a(Length Modifiers)
     *  The optional length modifier is a single character from the following
     *  list.
     *  @p(dlist)
     *      - `l`
     *          A  following integer conversion corresponds to a long int
     *          or unsigned long int argument
     *
     *  @p
     *
     *  @a(Conversion Specifiers)
     *  The following conversion specifiers are supported.
     *  @p(dlist)
     *      - `d`, `i`
     *          signed integer
     *      - `u`
     *          unsigned decimal
     *      - `x`
     *          unsigned hex
     *      - `o`
     *          unsigned octal
     *      - `p`
     *          pointer (@ + hex num)
     *      - `c`
     *          character
     *      - `s`
     *          string
     *  @p
     *  @a(Extended Conversion Specifiers)
     *  The following conversion specifiers are optionally supported.  See
     *  the `{@link #extendedFormats}` configuration parameter for more
     *  information about how to enable these conversion specifiers.
     *
     *  @p(dlist)
     *      - `f`
     *          decimal floating point.
     *      - `$`
     *          non-ANSI conversion prefix.  This prefix indicates that the
     *          next character identifies a non-ANSI standard conversion. See
     *          the next section for details.
     *  @p
     *
     *  @a(Non ANSI Conversion Specifiers)
     *  Among the extended conversion specifiers are unique specifiers which
     *  are not part of ANSI printf. These are specified using a $, for 
     *  example %$L.
     *
     *  These unique specifiers do not support the minimum field width
     *  attribute. Certain specifiers have additional restrictions; see below.
     *  
     *  @p(dlist)
     *      - '$L'
     *          The argument is treated as a pointer to a `{@link Types#Label}`
     *          and is converted to an appropriate string.
     *      - '$F'
     *          Displays a file and line number; used for displaying the call 
     *          site. This specifier consumes two arguments, the file and line 
     *          number, in that order. See an example below.
     *      - '$S'
     *          The argument is treated as a format string, and is recursively
     *          formatted using any following arguments. This specifier does 
     *          not support the use of the "precision" field for specifying 
     *          maximum string length.
     *  @p
     * 
     *  The following are example uses of the %$F and %$S format specifiers.
     *  
     *  In this call using %$F, the compiler recognizes these symbols and
     *  fills in the file and line number.
     *  @p(code)
     *  System_printf("%$F", __FILE__, __LINE__);
     *  @p
     *  This call outputs, for example,
     *  @p(code)
     *  "MyCode.c", line 35: 
     *  @p
     *  Here is an example using %$S, passing a recursive format string.
     *  @p(code)
     *  System_printf("Msg: %$S", "My msg, code: %d", 5);
     *  @p
     *  This outputs:
     *  @p(code)
     *  Msg: My msg, code: 5
     *  @p
