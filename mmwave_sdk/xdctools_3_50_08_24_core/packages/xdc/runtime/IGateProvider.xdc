/*!
 *  ======== IGateProvider ========
 *  Interface implemented by all gate providers
 *
 *  Gates are used within the `xdc.runtime` package to serialize access
 *  to data structures that are used by more than one thread.
 *
 *  Gates are responsible for ensuring that only one out of multiple threads
 *  can access a data structure at a time.  There are important scheduling
 *  latency and performance considerations that affect the "type" of gate used
 *  to protect each data structure.  For example, the best way to protect a
 *  shared counter is to simply disable all interrupts before the update and
 *  restore the interrupt state after the update; disabling all interrupts
 *  prevents all thread switching, so the update is guaranteed to be "atomic".
 *  Although highly efficient, this  method of creating atomic sections causes
 *  serious system latencies when the time required to update the data structure
 *  can't be bounded.
 *
 *  For example, a memory manager's list of free blocks can grow indefinitely
 *  long during periods of high fragmentation.  Searching such a list with
 *  interrupts disabled would cause system latencies to also become unbounded.
 *  In this case, the best solution is to provide a gate that suspends the
 *  execution of  threads that try to enter a gate that has already been
 *  entered; i.e., the gate "blocks" the thread until the thread already in the
 *  gate leaves.  The time required to enter and leave the gate is greater than
 *  simply enabling and restoring interrupts, but since the time spent within
 *  the gate is relatively large, the overhead caused by entering and leaving
 *  gates will not become a significant percentage of overall system time.  More
 *  importantly, threads that do not need to access the shared data structure
 *  are completely unaffected by threads that do access it.
 *
 *  @a(Notes)
 *  Modules inheriting this interface should treat all names beginning with
 *  `Q_` as reserved words, i.e. the names from that namespace should not
 *  be used.  This will allow future version of this interface to define new
 *  constants ("qualities" ) similar to `{@link #Q_BLOCKING}` and
 *  `{@link #Q_PREEMPTING}` without breaking any existing modules.
