/*!
 *  ======== Main ========
 *  Configuration "stand-in" for application code.
 *
 *  This module is used to enable "module" configuration of application code
 *  that is not part of a module.  Configuration of this `Main` module is
 *  used for all code not in a module.
 *
 *  For example, an `ILogger` "service provider" for all code that is not in
 *  a RTSC module can be configured by setting this module's `logger`;  when
 *  code that is not in a module calls `Log_print()`, for example, this
 *  module's `ILogger` handles the event.
 *
 *  Since this module is "gated", the user can also assign a gate to this
 *  module for use by any code that is not in a module.  This gate can be used
 *  to serialize access to global data by multiple threads in the system.
 *  @p(code)
 *      #include <xdc/runtime/Main.h>
 *      #include <xdc/runtime/Gate.h>
 *          :
 *      int global = 0;
 *      int main() {
 *          :       // create a bunch of threads
 *      }
 *
 *      void thread() {
 *          IArg key = Gate_enterModule();  // enter critical section
 *          global++;                       // safely update global data
 *          Gate_leaveModule(key);          // leave critical section
 *      }
 *  @p
