/*!
 *  ======== LoggerSys ========
 *  A logger which routes events to the `System_printf` function.
 *
 *  This logger processes log events as they are generated and routes
 *  them through the `{@link System#printf System_printf()}` function.
 *  The final disposition of the log event is dependent on which system
 *  provider has been assigned to the
 *  `{@link System#SupportProxy System.SupportProxy}` configuration parameter.
 *
 *  Note that the log events are processed within the runtime context
 *  of the `{@link Log Log_write()}` or `{@link Log Log_print()}` function
 *  that generated the event. It is important to account for the processing
 *  overhead and stack usage imposed on the runtime context. The cost of
 *  this processing is defined by the implementation of the system provider.
 *
 *  @a(Examples)
 *  Configuration example: The following XDC configuration statements
 *  create a logger instance, assign it as the default logger for all
 *  modules, and enable `USER1` logging in all modules of the package
 *  `my.pkg`. See the `{@link Diags#setMaskMeta Diags.setMaskMeta()}` function
 *  for details on specifying the module names.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  var Defaults = xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.Defaults');
 *  var Diags = xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.Diags');
 *  var LoggerSys = xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.LoggerSys');
 *
 *  var LoggerSysParams = new LoggerSys.Params();
 *  Defaults.common$.logger = LoggerSys.create(LoggerSysParams);
 *  Diags.setMaskMeta("my.pkg.%", Diags.USER1, Diags.RUNTIME_ON);
 *  @p
