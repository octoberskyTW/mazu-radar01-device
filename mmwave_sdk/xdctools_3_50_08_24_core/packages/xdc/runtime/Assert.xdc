/*!
 *  ======== Assert ========
 *  Runtime assertion manager
 *
 *  The `Assert` module provides configurable diagnostics to the program.
 *  Similar to the standard C `assert()` macro, `Assert` methods are
 *  interspersed with other code to add diagnostics to a program. Unlike
 *  the standard C assert support, the `Assert` module provides greater
 *  flexibility in managing the messages displayed, the message string
 *  space overhead, and the runtime handling of failures. In addition,
 *  because the `Assert` methods build atop the Diags module, you can
 *  precisely control which asserts remain in the final application, if any.
 *
 *  The `Assert` module works in conjunction with the `{@link Diags}` module.
 *  `Assert` statements are added to the code using the
 *  `{@link #isTrue Assert_isTrue()}` function. Execution of assert
 *  statements is controlled by the `{@link Diags#ASSERT}` and
 *  `{@link Diags#INTERNAL}` bits in a module's diagnostics mask. By default,
 *  all module's `Diags_ASSERT` bit is enabled and the `Diags_INTERNAL` bit
 *  is disabled.  See `{@link Types#Common$ Types.Common$}` for the
 *  declaration of the bits in the diagnostics mask and
 *  `{@link Defaults#common$ Default.common$}` for the default module settings.
 *
 *  Two types of asserts are supported: public asserts and internal asserts.
 *
 *  @p(blist)
 *  - Public asserts have an assert ID and are, by default, controlled
 *  by the `{@link Diags#ASSERT}` bit.
 *  - Internal asserts don't have an assert ID (other than NULL) and
 *  are active only when both the `{@link Diags#ASSERT}` and
 *  `{@link Diags#INTERNAL}` bits of the module's diagnostics mask are set.
 *  @p
 *
 *  `Assert` IDs are small integer values that index into a table of
 *  assertion descriptors. These descriptors hold an error message
 *  and a diagnostics mask that is used to enable and disable the
 *  assertion at runtime.
 *
 *  You can remap individual public asserts to different bits in the
 *  diagnostics mask, or can disable the assert altogether. This is
 *  done by setting the mask property of the assert ID. Setting the
 *  mask to 0 disables the assert. In all other cases, the `Diags.ASSERT`
 *  bit is OR'd together with the mask to define the controlling bits.
 *  For example, the module's diagnostics mask must have the `Diags.ASSERT`
 *  bit set and any other bit specified in the mask property of the
 *  assert ID in order to activate the assert.
 *
 *  @a(Examples)
 *  @p(html)
 *  <hr />
 *  @p
 *  Example 1: The following C code adds an assert to application code
 *  which is not in a module. This assert does not have an assert
 *  identifier (the second argument is NULL); this makes it an internal
 *  assert.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  // file.c
 *  #include <xdc/runtime/Assert.h>
 *
 *  Assert_isTrue(count > 0, NULL);
 *  @p
 *
 *  The following XDC configuration statements set both the ASSERT and
 *  INTERNAL bits in the diagnostics mask to enable the internal assert
 *  created in the previous C code. Since the C code is not in a module,
 *  you must set the bits in the diagnostics mask of the
 *  `{@link xdc.runtime.Main xdc.runtime.Main}` module. The Main module
 *  is used to control all `{@link Log}` and `Assert` statements that are
 *  not part of the implementation of a module; for example, top-level
 *  application code or any existing sources that simply call the `Log` or
 *  `Assert` methods.
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  // program.cfg
 *  var Assert = xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.Assert');
 *  var Diags = xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.Diags');
 *  var Main = xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.Main');
 *
 *  Main.common$.diags_ASSERT = Diags.ALWAYS_ON;
 *  Main.common$.diags_INTERNAL = Diags.ALWAYS_ON;
 *  @p
 *
 *  @p(html)
 *  <hr />
 *  @p
 *  Example 2: The following example shows how to use and configure an
 *  assert ID that is declared by a module. It adds that assert to the
 *  application's C source code, and configures the application to
 *  execute the assert.
 *
 *  This is part of the XDC file for the module that declares an `Assert` Id:
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  // Mod.xdc
 *  import xdc.runtime.Assert;
 *  import xdc.runtime.Diags;
 *
 *  config Assert.Id A_nonZero = {
 *      msg: "A_nonZero: value must be non-zero"
 *  };
 *  @p
 *
 *  This is part of the C code for the application:
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  // Mod.c
 *  #include <xdc/runtime/Assert.h>
 *
 *  Assert_isTrue(x != 0, Mod_A_nonZero);
 *  @p
 *
 *  This is part of the XDC configuration file for the application:
 *
 *  @p(code)
 *  // program.cfg
 *  var Diags = xdc.useModule('xdc.runtime.Diags');
 *  var Mod = xdc.useModule('my.pkg.Mod');
 *  Mod.common$.diags_ASSERT = Diags.ALWAYS_ON;
 *  @p
 *
 *  The Assert calls can also be completely removed by defining the symbol
 *  xdc_runtime_Assert_DISABLE_ALL. This can be done on the compile line, e.g.
 *  -Dxdc_runtime_Assert_DISABLE_ALL. This will completely remove the Assert
 *  statements from any code compiled with this flag, regardless of the
 *  application's configuration or your compiler's optimization settings.
 *
 *  It is also possible to remove all conditions from Assert calls. As explained
 *  above, Assert calls are executed only if certain bits in the module's
 *  Diags mask are set. However, if the symbol
 *  xdc_runtime_Assert_DISABLE_CONDITIONAL_ASSERT is defined, the module's Diags 
 *  mask is not queried at all, and all Assert calls are unconditionally
 *  executed.
 *  The symbol xdc_runtime_Assert_DISABLE_ALL has a precedence, and if it's
 *  set, no Assert calls are executed regardless of any definition of
 *  xdc_runtime_Assert_DISABLE_CONDITIONAL_ASSERT.
