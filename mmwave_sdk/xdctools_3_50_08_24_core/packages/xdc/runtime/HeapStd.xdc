 *  ======== HeapStd ========
 *  Malloc/free based heap implementation.
 *
 *  This heap is based on the ANSI C Standard Library functions
 *  `malloc()` and `free()` and assumes that these functions are thread-safe.
 *  Please refer to the target specific documentation of the ANSI C Standard
 *  Library for details.
 *
 *  The largest free block that can be returned form `malloc()` cannot be
 *  determined. Therefore, the property `largestFreeSize` in
 *  `{@link Memory#Stats}` returned from `{@link #getStats()}` always returns
 *  0.
 *
 *  @a(Constraints)
 *  The `{@link #alloc()}` function only supports alignment requests up to
 *  value returned from
 *  `{@link Memory#getMaxDefaultTypeAlign()}`.
