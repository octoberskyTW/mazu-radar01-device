     *  uses information from the target and this platform's
     *  `{@link #codeMemory}`, `{@link #dataMemory}`, and
     *  `{@link #stackMemory}` configuration parameters.
     *
     *  `sectMap` is used to override this default placement of
     *  output sections (".text", ".cinit", etc.) to a memory 
     *  segment defined by the platform's memory map.  For example, even if
     *  a platform's `codeMemory` parameter is defined to be "SRAM" and
     *  ".cinit" output sections are "code" sections, if the platform also
     *  defines the following `sectMap`, the section ".cinit" will be placed
     *  into a memory segment named "DDR2".
     *  @p(code)
     *      sectMap[] = [
     *          [".cinit", "DDR2"],
     *      ];
     *  @p
     *
     *  @a(Note) If an output section has an entry in
     *  `{@link xdc.cfg.Program#sectMap Program.sectMap}`, that entry
     *  overrides the placement specified by this `sectMap`.  A program's
     *  `sectMap` configuration always overrides the platform's `sectMap`
     *  settings.
     *
     *  @a(Default Mapping)
     *  The default placement of a target's output sections into memory
     *  segments defined by the platform is determined by the following

     *      - `{@link xdc.bld.ITarget#sectMap ITarget.sectMap}`
