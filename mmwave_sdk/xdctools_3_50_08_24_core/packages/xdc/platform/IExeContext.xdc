 *  Execution environment interface between a platform and an executable

 *
 *  Execution contexts are created by platforms via
 *  `{@link xdc.platform.IPlatform#getExeContext()}`.  Execution contexts are
 *  created implicitly just prior to executing a program's configuration
 *  script.  This execution context is made available to the configuration
 *  script as the global read-only `Program.cpu` configuration parameter;
 *  see `{@link xdc.cfg.Program}`.
