 *  ======== Trace ========
 *  Trace support
 *
 *  This module allows system integrators to selectively enable trace
 *  statements, from within XDCscripts. Trace statements can be selected
 *  based on the file (capsule) and the package in which they are located.
 *  For example, trace statements from file `Mod.xs` in package `myPkgs.pkgA'
 *  can be enabled either with `Trace.capsuleEnable(["myPkgs/pkgA/Mod"])` or
 *  with `Trace.packageEnable(["myPkgs.pkgA"])`.
 *
 *  Trace statements can also belong to groups, strings defined by package
 *  producers when they need to group related trace statements, distributed
 *  across different modules and packages, into trace units that can be
 *  disabled or enabled as a whole. If some of the trace statements from file
 *  `Mod.xs` are tagged to belong to a group "init", the following will
 *  activate them:
 *  @p(code)
 *  Trace.groupEnable(["init"]);
 *  @p
 *
 *  Each trace statement by default belongs to the group "all". To activate
 *  all trace statements:
 *  @p(code)
 *  Trace.setLevel(2);
 *  Trace.groupEnable(["all"]);
 *  @p
 *
