 *  ======== IProductView ========
 *  @_nodoc
 *  Provide product organization details
 *
 *  The IProductView interface allows RTSC products to provide
 *  a logical view for consumption within IDE frameworks like eclipse.
 *  The interface defines a structure 'ProductElemDesc' that can be
 *  used to define the product as a logical grouping of modules.
 *   
 *  The 'ProductElemDesc' structure can be built recursively to
 *  form a tree. The implementor can also control the display of the
 *  tree elements by associating icons with individual nodes of the tree.
 *  
 *  The interface also defines a method called 'getProductDescriptor'
 *  that maybe queried by the IDE to get the defined 'ProductElemDesc'
 *  structure. The IDE can then build a graphical tree view of the product.
