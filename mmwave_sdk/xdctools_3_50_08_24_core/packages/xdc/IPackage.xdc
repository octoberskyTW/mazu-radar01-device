/*!
 *  ======== IPackage ========
 *  Base interface implemented by all packages.
 *
 *  If a package does not specify a function declared in
 *  `IPackage`, the default defined in this package is used.
 *
 *  Packages must implement `IPackage` functions in the package's `package.xs`
 *  file.  This file simply defines a function with the same name as that
 *  declared in the the this specification.  For example, to implement the
 *  `{@link #getLibs()}` function the following must appear in the package's
 *  `package.xs` file:
 *  @p(code)
 *      function getLibs(prog)
 *      {
 *           ...
 *      }
 *  @p
 *
 *  @a(Note)
 *  Since most `IPackage` functions can be called in any model, any access to
 *  global variables specific to a particular object model should happen only
 *  if the function is called in the context of that model. For example, the
 *  variable `Program` is a global variable in the Configuration Model
 *  (`{@link xdc.cfg.Program}`). Any access to it should happen after a check
 *  that the current model is the Configuration Model:
 *  @p(code)
 *      if (xdc.om.$name == "cfg") {
 *          print(Program.build.target.name);
 *      }
 *  @p
 *  For additional information about `xdc.om`, see
 *  {@link http://rtsc.eclipse.org/docs-tip/XDCscript_-_xdc.om xdc.om} in the
 *  {@link http://rtsc.eclipse.org/docs-tip/XDCscript_Language_Reference XDCscript Language Reference}.
