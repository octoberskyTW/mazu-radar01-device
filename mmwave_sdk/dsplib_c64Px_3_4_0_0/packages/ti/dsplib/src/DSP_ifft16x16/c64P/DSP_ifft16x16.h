/**
 *      This code performs a Radix-4 IFFT with digit reversal.  The code
 *      uses a special ordering of twiddle factors and memory accesses  
 *      to improve performance in the presence of cache.  It operates   
 *      largely in-place, but the final digit-reversed output is written
 *      out-of-place.                                                   
 *
 *      @param ptr_w:   Pointer to vector of Q.15 FFT coefficients of size 2*nx elements.
 *      @param npoints: Number of complex elements in vector x.       
 *      @param ptr_x:   Pointer to input vector of size 2*nx elements.
 *      @param ptr_y:   Pointer to output vector of size 2*nx elements.
 *
 * @par Algorithm:
 * DSP_ifft16x16_cn.c is the natural C equivalent of the optimized intrinsic C code without
 * restrictions. Note that the intrinsic C code is optimized and restrictions may
 * apply.  
 * 
 * @par Assumptions:
 *     In-place computation is not allowed. <BR>                              
 *     Size of FFT, nx, must be power of 2 and 16<=nx<=32768. <BR>                                  
 *     The arrays for the complex input data x[], complex output data y[]
 *        and twiddle factor w[] must be double word aligned. <BR> 
 *     The input and output data are complex, with the real/imaginary 
 *        components stored in adjacent locations in the array.  The real
 *        components are stored at even array indices, and the imaginary 
 *        components are stored at odd array indices. <BR>                     
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 * @b Endian Support: 
 *    The intrinsic optimized C code supports both big and little endian modes. <BR>  
 *    The linear assembly code supports little endian mode only. <BR>  
 * @b Interruptibility: The code is interruptible.
